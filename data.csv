"Nevermind,",Crusch
"A story without greed. Healing a wounded dragon, and then wishing to adopt it.",Crusch
"My body won't be satisfied by any dragon except you now! Oh, Patrasche, you minx!",Subaru
She's not gonna get thrown off or anything right?,Subaru
Me?,Subaru
"That's me activating my skill, KUUKI YOMENAI. Please put up with it.",Subaru
"But, he's a guy.",Subaru
"If you're that proud about it, what's with the outfit. What about this is a guy?",Subaru
But that's something...,Subaru
...Huh?,Subaru
Fe-Felis?,Subaru
Don't say that while smiling! Also don't threaten partners in your ally!,Subaru
That's worse! Geez.,Subaru
"Ah, Subaru. Is Rem-san's bed properly set up?",Emilia
There's a shame. My heart was pounding anticipating how you'd feel about the tightrope.,Subaru
"Yes, right.",Crusch
"Thanks. —I don't remember becoming yours yet, though.",Emilia
"But even if I weren't, I'm a half-elf. A silver-haired one. ...aren't you afraid?",Emilia
"Emilia-tan, that's...",Subaru
—,Emilia
"Emilia-sama, would you yourself believe your manner of living embarrassing?",Crusch
I am glad to have become your acquaintance. No fear is in me in the least.,Crusch
—hk,Emilia
"Stay in health. I will be awaiting the next, surely not distant, time we may meet.",Crusch
"Absolutely, let us meet again.",Crusch
—Hrn.,Subaru
"Just butting yourself right in and what do you say? Or rather, you were here?",Subaru
What is it?,Otto
That's not what the request is about! Just what exactly do you think I am?!,Otto
A merchant who spices things up?,Subaru
He's treating me like something bawdy!,Otto
It's like... you two get along sooo well. I'm surprised.,Emilia
"Shut up, Otto.",Subaru
"Ah, wait, if you do that then it'd be like you're excluding me —",Otto
"Yup, shutting you out!",Subaru
Pfff.,Subaru
Heehehe.,Emilia
Wasn't like me to read the awkward mood and keep quiet.,Subaru
"You're already zipping over to sit beside me, Subaru.",Emilia
"I do believe that, but whether I accept it is another story.",Emilia
"That's fine. Believe, and from there I'll work to make you accept it.",Subaru
"This is more like me than looking down and being depressed. Right, Rem?",Subaru
...What did you just say?,Emilia
"And you immediately cover it up. ...You're worried about Rem-san, aren't you?",Emilia
"You love her, don't you?",Emilia
"Love her, love her a lot. I love her as much as I love you, Emilia-tan.",Subaru
"Saying this is a bit, but... Subaru, are you cheating?",Emilia
Even though you said you love me.,Emilia
I think I understand.,Emilia
Huh?,Subaru
"A disease. ...Well, I can't refute that.",Subaru
You won't get me so easily.,Emilia
Need to have you pull me 'till I'm torn apart.,Subaru
"In the end, we can't come up with a real plan without talking to Roz-chi.",Subaru
"That's quite an aggressive stance to take towards your employer the Margrave, Natsuki-san.",Otto
"He's playing it safe, or...",Subaru
Something happened at SANCTUARY?,Emilia
"Doesn't look like anything's changed, though. ...Doesn't feel like Ram's come back.",Subaru
"Ugh. Anyway, for now all we can do is pray Beako knows something.",Subaru
Did you just say 'ugh' while looking at me?,Otto
Ugh. You're being too self-conscious. No one cares about you as much as you think.,Subaru
That's a terrible thing to say!,Otto
"I'm back, Roswaal mansion. Now, how would my nostalgic old home be...",Subaru
It's not disturbed... it's all orderly!?,Subaru
The mansion's living room...,Subaru
"Ah, Subaru, you're awake?",Emilia
"Eerrm, what was it that just happened again, Emilia-tan?",Subaru
I was sleeping?,Subaru
"That's not really the right word... but, it's mostly not wrong?",Emilia
Freakface!,Subaru
"Huu, euhu...",Frederica
Wha?,Subaru
"Subaru, you idiot!",Emilia
How could you say that to a girl? Frederica's been so dedicated to your...,Emilia
"Interloper? ...Ah, wait. I think I kinda get what the story is.",Subaru
Exactly correct. ...You would appear to be rather the quick thinker.,Frederica
"If I couldn't get that much from the gist of the conversation, it'd be... No, firstly.",Subaru
—Huuhuu. You are quite an interesting one.,Frederica
Test?,Subaru
Fwauhh!?,Subaru
Fred. Er. I. Ca.,Emilia
No way!,Emilia
"Indeed, and of course I accept. So let us proceed in our acquaintance.",Frederica
"So three months ago means she's an acquaintance of yours, Emilia-tan?",Subaru
Harrumph. Seems she is.,Emilia
"Who says 'harrumph' anymore? Also sulking like that is so outdated it's cute, man.",Subaru
A note?,Subaru
"Ram called you back to the mansion, meaning?",Subaru
...You won't tease me like that anymore?,Emilia
All right. I won't be angry any more. Okay?,Emilia
"Yes. My deepest apologies, Emilia-sama. —She's so easy.",Frederica
"Umm, the reason Ram called Frederica back to the mansion... right.",Emilia
"You're wrong. You've got it wrong, Otto.",Subaru
"I have what wrong. If you think you can take back what you said, it's too late...",Otto
So my stock just fell twice!? That only makes things even worse!,Otto
I... don't know what you're talking about. More importantly...,Otto
—don't touch Rem.,Subaru
"This isn't a good trend... Shit, I'm pathetic. Why I am goddamn always like this...",Subaru
"My just desserts.... no, Rem's the one paying for it. What a fucking gigolo I am.",Subaru
—ah.,Subaru
Wh—Subaru!?,Emilia
"I'm so incredibly astounded at the limits of my own idiocy, seriously.",Subaru
"Emilia-tan, a request.",Subaru
"Wh-what is it? Hold on, Subaru, your face's so close, your eyes look scary...",Emilia
"Wondering if you could insult my stupid, unsalvagable self.",Subaru
Huh?,Emilia
"Please. With no forgiveness for me, insult me.",Subaru
I-I'm telling you I can't do that. I don't think anything's your fault at all...,Emilia
Do something about that!,Subaru
But even if you tell me to do something...,Emilia
"Please! If you can do it, I'll sacrifice my soul to you, Emilia-tan!",Subaru
"Subaru, you idiot.",Emilia
Ughuh,Subaru
"You stubborn, selfish, bratty, overenthusiastic, bad-tempered rascal.",Emilia
Ughuhhuhhgh,Subaru
Ughhu... huh?,Subaru
"Who says dunderhead anymore? ...I mean, Emilia-tan.",Subaru
What?,Emilia
That's seriously how you think of me?,Subaru
"Thanks, Emilia-tan.",Subaru
"All I did was complain about you. And you thank me for it... Subaru, are you a pervert?",Emilia
"Unfortunately, the wishing booth has been closed for today.",Emilia
Goddamn! A failure! Why am I always... too late... hk!,Subaru
I'm going to a stinky mouldy room to see a shut-in drill loli.,Subaru
"Hey, been a while.",Subaru
"—Think the mansion's gotten noisy, and you come back, I suppose.",Beatrice
"So irritating, in fact.",Beatrice
"That you've come back means it's safe to say that racket's settled down, I suppose.",Beatrice
"This one, yeah?",Subaru
"...One next to it, I suppose. If you're going to meddle, meddle properly, in fact.",Beatrice
"I won't thank you, I suppose.",Beatrice
Their worrying was nothing I....,Beatrice
"But they did leave the mansion in the end, I suppose. ...They left Betty.",Beatrice
"Don't make things up, in fact. I haven't shed a single tear in a long time, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Indicative words coming from the man who cried on the lap of the girl he loves, in fact.",Beatrice
Could you please forget about that!?,Subaru
"Anyway, putting aside the topic of crying or not crying... could I ask you something?",Subaru
"Could or could not, asking is at your liberty, I suppose.",Beatrice
"—You know, for noticing the racket that went on outside, you were pretty nonreactive.",Subaru
"Stop, in fact.",Beatrice
"Stop, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Tearjerking to both speak and hear, I traversed the path of a crying queen bee —hk!",Subaru
"Get to the real topic already, in fact. —You weakling.",Beatrice
...ahh.,Subaru
Do you...,Subaru
Do you remember Rem?,Subaru
"Please answer. You remember the Rem who was in this mansion, right?",Subaru
Hey...,Subaru
"—I don't want to answer, in fact.",Beatrice
I'm telling you that's not an answer!,Subaru
This isn't what I want to hear from you!,Subaru
You...hk!,Subaru
"Your question is inquiring about somebody eaten by GLUTTONY, in fact.",Beatrice
—! So you really do...,Subaru
Roz!?,Subaru
"If you don't know, then surely nobody knows, in fact.",Beatrice
—a gospel.,Beatrice
"Why, how do you...",Beatrice
"Took it... but, that's...",Beatrice
"The owner is... dead, you said, I suppose.",Beatrice
...Yeah. Dead. Chewed up in a carriage's wheel. ...I killed him.,Subaru
"You left Betty behind too, I suppose, Juice...",Beatrice
—? Who?,Subaru
"Witch, Factor?",Subaru
Was just clearing away some loose sparks! What is it you want to say?!,Subaru
What're you just agreeing to yourself ab—uuoah,Subaru
A beverage resting in peace! What do you—me...,Subaru
—Betty's...,Beatrice
Beako... Beatrice!,Subaru
"What's instigating their exit is your body, and your soul, in fact.",Beatrice
What're—,Subaru
I—,Subaru
"Betty isn't... just a tool for your convenience, I suppose.",Beatrice
—!?,Subaru
Cra—,Subaru
...Why do you look like you're gonna cry.,Subaru
That drill loli...,Subaru
"If you're that close on the verge of crying, don't lock yourself up all alone. Idiot.",Subaru
"If you're going to have cheery chipper talks with Emilia-tan while I'm away, just die.",Subaru
Did you see Beatrice?,Emilia
"No, didn't work out.",Subaru
...You saw her?,Emilia
"I've been thinking this for a while but, you and Beatrice... get along so well, Subaru.",Emilia
"Yes, yes.",Emilia
"Ah, is she.",Subaru
But you spilled it yourself!,Otto
You two get along sooo well. Even though you've barely known each other long at all.,Emilia
"Why am I being dumped. It's completely irrelevant to reality, but it's still upsetting!",Otto
Sorry.,Emilia
"Scrupulousness... Second floor, furthest room back?",Subaru
"...No. Just a feeling, doesn't really mean anything.",Subaru
"—I had heard the circumstances, yet I am still surprised.",Frederica
"Ah, no.",Frederica
Subaru-sama. I would believe it acceptable should the one tasked to carry her be me.,Frederica
My heart does feel pain when casually dissed!,Subaru
"An admirable line, although it feels to have been soured.",Frederica
It appears that you have spoken with Beatrice-sama.,Frederica
"Uhh... Have you been working for the mansion long, Frederica?",Subaru
It seems I've accidentally come to be hated.,Frederica
"There is no need for such concern. You would be quite the worrier, Subaru-sama.",Frederica
"Uncomfortable—would not be how I would describe you, but you are a peculiar one.",Frederica
Emilia-tan what?,Subaru
Uhhhh,Subaru
"I am afraid you would be mistaken, Subaru-sama.",Frederica
Would you still be yet to understand it?,Frederica
Her appearance doesn't change. ...She really isn't a human.,Subaru
"Great Spirit... is the same title Puck has, but man they look and whatever nothing alike.",Subaru
Really no way that's happening.,Subaru
Frederica.,Subaru
"That is fine, but my arms shall soon reach their limit.",Subaru
Oh dear.,Frederica
"Move aside promptly, please!",Subaru
—Took you a while.,Emilia
It all depends on how hard I work.,Subaru
What did you talk with Frederica about?,Emilia
"Wow, really? Subaru, you know so much about SHUT-IN. It's amazing.",Emilia
Which means you couldn't get anything out of Beatrice?,Emilia
"It happens sometimes? But this time it's got you worried, too.",Subaru
"Puck and Beako too, everyone's gone and shut their mouths... I'm defeated.",Subaru
"Seriously. ...Subaru, what do we do?",Emilia
You mean Roswaal.,Emilia
I figure now's a great time for a chat cutting all the underground circumstances loose.,Subaru
"Oh, 'love' as if... Subaru, you just say things to make others happy sooo often.",Emilia
"So, I have a proposal for Subaru, who's allying with me.",Emilia
"Yup yup, let's hear it, say whatever you want.",Subaru
SANCTUARY...,Subaru
"Wa-wa-wai, time out! You're not saying you're leaving me behind, are you?",Subaru
Huh?,Emilia
It wasn't as though I was going to leave you. Come with me.,Emilia
Don't leave me behind don'tdon'tdon't—what did you just say?,Subaru
"I said, come with me. I'd be so anxious I couldn't bear it, being all alone.",Emilia
E-Emilia-tan...,Subaru
"I rely on you, Subaru. I don't think you're weak or stupid at all. I need your strength.",Emilia
"Er, um, uh, what is it? Did, did I say something strange again...?",Emilia
Huwawhegh!?,Subaru
Preparations? So you're coming too?,Subaru
Patrasche?,Subaru
"You're just getting better and better, Patrasche. Seriously, how did I hit that flag?",Subaru
"More importantly, there are several matters on which I must speak with you.",Frederica
"—Yes, I'm prepared. Since it's a place with some history.",Emilia
Your impurity is so pure it conversely becomes refreshing.,Frederica
"Methodical or perhaps it's neuroticism, either way you're definitely a type A.",Subaru
"What is that, that 'taeype ahye.' It doesn't sound like it means much good.",Otto
"Actually, I just thought something.",Otto
"What, your hands've stopped. You had a good pace there keep going.",Subaru
Sure took you a while to notice.,Subaru
"Basically it's the strategy of 'if you have no allies nearby, why not just make one?'",Subaru
That there's nothing relaxing about this at all actually makes it amazing!,Otto
"Frank, aren't you. —I understand, but, terms?",Otto
"And this one is just going off patten, but.",Subaru
—Let's hear it.,Otto
So it's only your rivals in love who get exterminated!,Otto
It's truly mundane.,Otto
And that's your dream?,Subaru
"He's terrible no matter what angle you look at him, this man!",Otto
A-A set-up!?,Otto
"Great work, Petra. But won't Frederica get mad at you for using your time on this?",Subaru
You're a crafty one. So even a little girl is still a woman...,Subaru
"I never said anything about joining this team, okay? Please don't misunderstand?",Otto
"I wanna be on the lady's side, but I don't really wanna lose to her on anything important...",Petra
Right right... But you're seriously coming too?,Subaru
Isn't it a given!?,Otto
"Hey, all that trust's gonna make me blush.",Subaru
All we'd have left between us would be jeering and fistfights then!,Otto
"Thinking like that, my offensive worth really is low. I knew that but it's still depressing.",Subaru
"Pl-please, wait. Suba, Subaru-sama...",Petra
Did you forget what you just said three seconds ago!?,Otto
I want you to please take this before you leave. Please hold on to it.,Petra
"Embroidery, huh. Wow, it's really good.",Subaru
Haha,Emilia
"It's the Puck Subaru drew. It's amazing, you did it really well.",Emilia
I did do really well with my chibi Puck. I didn't think I'd get to see it again.,Subaru
I make sure to get my stamps after radio callisthenics every morning.,Petra
"That said, you did really good. Even a sewing master such as myself could lose to this.",Subaru
"Can you please... no, could you please take it?",Petra
"I will be waiting for your safe return. Ah, and the lady and the noisy man too.",Petra
I feel like an extra.,Emilia
Isn't that assessment of me kind of horrible!?,Otto
"Here you go, Emilia-tan. Right into my chest.",Subaru
Maybe it'd be nice to look at the scenery from the driver's platform every once in a while?,Emilia
"Aaah, cold! EMK (Emilia-tan Maji Koakuma)! —Dah, waaah!",Subaru
What is it?,Emilia
"Uhrhumm, nothing?",Subaru
"Well then, we'll be setting off. I'll be praying you don't bite your tongues, or anything.",Otto
That's what you're planning?,Emilia
"Me!? I'm not going along with this nefarious plot, and now I'm suddenly complicit!?",Otto
"Well, destination, SANCTUARY! Departure, engage!",Subaru
Who are you to speak like that!?,Otto
You two take care of the mansion. And... I'm counting on you for Rem.,Subaru
"Be careful, and come home safely.",Petra
So Puck really hasn't shown up the whole time.,Subaru
Either way,Subaru
I'll be waiting without expectations.,Emilia
"But, SANCTUARY. Wonder what it's like.",Subaru
"Be careful of Garfiel, huh.",Subaru
"Got it. Yeah, if you have that it mind it does fit with the conditions.",Subaru
"But you know,",Subaru
I cannot apologize enough for that time!,Subaru
Ithurtsithurtsmyearstheyhurt!,Subaru
Ithurtsithurtsmyheartithurts!,Subaru
Did you reflect?,Emilia
"Then alright, I'll forgive you.",Emilia
"What'reya saying, you're not gonna be exposed to any danger. Believe in me, shield #2.",Subaru
You're second? Where's the first?,Emilia
Sitting on the driver's seat flirting with my Patrasche.,Subaru
Were you thinking about Rem-san?,Emilia
...You can tell?,Subaru
I can tell.,Emilia
"Ah, no call it a half of a half of a half of that.",Emilia
...Three hours....!,Subaru
From there a half of a half of a half of...,Emilia
Hearing the exact number'll hurt me that's enough!,Subaru
"That sounds like a cowardly way of saying it, but perhaps I'm just hearing things.",Emilia
No 'hearing things' more like hearing me.,Subaru
"It feels like Beatrice and Puck both know things, but are hiding them.",Emilia
—Looks like we've entered the forest.,Emilia
It's impressive you knew without even looking outside.,Subaru
"—!? Hey, hold on!",Subaru
—,Emilia
"E-Emilia-tan? What happened, Emilia!?",Subaru
"Otto! There's trouble, Emilia suddenly collapsed! Do you have medicine, or...",Subaru
"Ah—Natsuki-san, I'm sorry.",Otto
"Uh, wha?",Subaru
Patrasche!!,Subaru
"All good, you. Great thatya moved right away, better yer not givin' up now. You pass.",Garfiel
He-he flung away Patrasche...?,Subaru
"Now, goin' from looks, guess you two're allth's left.",Garfiel
I...,Subaru
Y-you...,Subaru
Hmmm?,Garfiel
"Yer whisperin', now speak up.",Garfiel
"You're... Garfiel, right. The one Roswaal and Frederica know.",Subaru
—Frederica?,Garfiel
She's a half-elf. Don't you dare call her that to her face.,Subaru
"—Haa. 'S with that, yer face's gotten all pumped all the sudden.",Garfiel
You...,Subaru
Get fucked.,Subaru
Hmmm?,Garfiel
"Take back that bullshit moniker, and never use it again.",Subaru
—Heehaha.,Garfiel
—Huh?,Subaru
"Heehahaha! 'S some pretty bitin' words, those, oi.",Garfiel
"What're you... ow! Ah, what, ow, wait, that hurts!",Subaru
"Stop makin' a racket, 's 'nnoying. Yer don't gotta be panicked I ain't gonna eat ya.",Garfiel
"With how violent you were being before, who could just believe that...?",Subaru
That fucking pervert bastard...,Garfiel
"Got it, got it.",Garfiel
She'll come to if we get away from here?,Subaru
"You the driver? After I get the carriage back upright, yer drivin' us to the village.",Garfiel
Hey. This guy always so energetic?,Garfiel
...shutup.,Emilia
"Well I said it, didn't I? Ain't like there's anythin' weird 'bout it.",Garfiel
You really don't think my amazin' self's a fittin' match for strongest?,Garfiel
"Even if you tell me to keep that in mind, I don't know what it means...",Subaru
"Well, I missed the chance to ask you about this before, but you know Roswaal... yeah?",Subaru
SANCTUARY.,Garfiel
Think it's 'bout time Sleepin' Beauty got up. We're plenty far from the barrier.,Garfiel
"What's the barrier... ah, Emilia-tan?",Subaru
"Mornin', suhbaru...",Emilia
"Uhh, no? I don't feel anything strange, but...",Emilia
"A-are you okay, Subaru? I, went and collapsed when I said I'd protect you...",Emilia
See? Just like how I said.,Garfiel
"—Who are you!? Letting you know, I won't allow you to lay a single finger on Subaru!",Emilia
This is... Garfiel? The one Frederica mentioned?,Emilia
"Most gracious welcome, dear Emilia-sama and entourage.",Garfiel
Test site?,Subaru
Idiots—,Emilia
Place's thick with a depressing atmosphere...,Subaru
"What would 'Witch of Greed's Cemetery' mean, exactly?",Emilia
"Wha, really? But wouldn't they have been well-known people for the last 400 years?",Emilia
And this place would be one of them?,Emilia
"That's a terrifying thought, Natsuki-san, but there's no need to worry.",Otto
Witch-related.,Subaru
Weird to hear that kinda spite coming from you. It's almost like you were involved in it.,Subaru
All satisfied?,Garfiel
—? What's that mean?,Subaru
"Excuse me. We're just about to arrive, but is it alright for us to simply continue inside?",Otto
Nah.,Garfiel
"'S incredible logic, I don't get it at all!",Garfiel
—Ram!,Subaru
I'll pick up your bones!,Subaru
"Now,",Subaru
What is it?,Ram
Does he love you? That's sorta what it felt like from what he was saying.,Subaru
...And just when I began to wonder what you'd say.,Ram
"Nothing,",Emilia
—Subaru?,Emilia
"Let's go. No matter what happens, just leave it to meat shield #2.",Subaru
—Yeah.,Emilia
"Now,",Roswaal
"A witch's cemetery, is a muuuuuch more easily agreed term for it.",Roswaal
—I am deeeeeeefinitely satisfied. You truuuuuly were a find.,Roswaal
"The cathedral. Putting that off for now, the next point'd be...",Subaru
—Witch.,Subaru
Echidna...,Emilia
"Witch of, Greed... a witch destroyed by the Witch of Envy, a different witch.",Emilia
"Waitwaitwait, isn't what you're saying weird.",Subaru
—Echidna.,Emilia
Huh?,Subaru
...hk. D-Don't you say anything unnecessary. Surprise attacks are off-limits.,Emilia
Can't go back to going back?,Subaru
"So, there's an indirect connection.",Subaru
It feels like I'm seeing a child who's all grown up.,Roswaal
"—Barusu, would you care to display some sympathy for Roswaal-sama?",Ram
"Anyway,",Emilia
As healing magics are outside of my area of expertise...,Ram
The Great Spirit isn't here?,Roswaal
"Now that you mention it, Otto's not here... did he go home? Did you eat him?",Subaru
Tea.,Garfiel
"I'll go outside for a moment to gather the leaves, would you wait for me?",Ram
—Huh?,Emilia
This's what'm sayin' I don't like. That the people involved don't even...,Garfiel
...Subaru.,Emilia
"Fine! Yeah, I getit! 'S jus' lashin' out b'fore! Yer sayin' I lost my cool, 's my bad, okay, oi!",Garfiel
"No point'n praisin' me, 'm too dumb to understand it.",Garfiel
Here is the very essence of terrible tea.,Ram
Isn't that line more normally used when you're being self-deprecating?,Subaru
"As always, you're a man for whom brewing tea is worthless. Not someone suited to me.",Ram
'S just tastes like leaves. If yer gonna wet yer throat 's just th'same 's water. Yeh?,Garfiel
"My deepest apologies, Roswaal-sama. And while I was even present...",Ram
"Or really, you know this's because of your joking around?",Subaru
"Roswaal, I'll have to heal..",Emilia
"Noooooo, that will not be necessary, Emilia-sama.",Roswaal
"It's necessary...? But, what do you mean when you...",Emilia
"—Wow, sure 'bout that?",Garfiel
Never heard of such a mobile tomb before.,Subaru
"Just one more thing,",Subaru
There's something I want to ask you before we go to the tomb.,Subaru
Then I'll oblige. —Does the name 'Rem' sound familiar to you?,Subaru
...So?,Subaru
"Is that... right. No, it's okay. If you don't remember, that's inevitable. In, evitable.",Subaru
"Subaru, are you okay?",Emilia
Right. We'll do something. I'll be helping you.,Emilia
"Let's go, Subaru. I want Ram and Rem-san to meet each other soon too.",Emilia
"Uh, uhuh. Right. Yeah, you're right.",Subaru
Barusu.,Ram
The only one to enter the tomb will be Emilia-sama. You are absolutely not going in.,Ram
"This is the CEMETERY... meaning, it's safe to call this the Witch of Greed's tomb, right?",Subaru
"Relax, I hate gettin' tested too. So, well, the TRIAL... I dunno the content.",Garfiel
Hey now.,Subaru
Released... who exactly?,Subaru
Ehh...? 'S sorta like that... maybe?,Garfiel
I had it pretty succinct and you're really saying it's still not good enough?,Subaru
'S 'cause you ain't qualified.,Garfiel
"Waitwaitholdup. So basically, thinking about what you just said, then it'd mean this?",Subaru
"—Yeah, 'guess I didn't tell you.",Garfiel
...Wow. Can I pet you?,Subaru
So this village really is a gathering of demihumans...,Emilia
"Sorry, Ram. Doesn't look like I'll be able to stick by your warning.",Subaru
Whattyou said?,Garfiel
That's somethin' yer'd us'ly say when offerin' yerself up t'go!,Garfiel
"But,",Garfiel
Sorry 'cept I can't go in. Contract.,Garfiel
...Contract?,Subaru
"Yeah, 's a pain. 'N toppa that ain't like I even made it.",Garfiel
Could you wait here for a sec while I go look for Otto?,Subaru
The sun will set while you're off doing that. —It's okay. I'll go.,Emilia
"Like Roswaal... you mean, his wounds were because he went inside?",Subaru
"...Yeah, I'm going in first.",Subaru
"You know, it still does make me happy you're worried for me.",Subaru
What we can do?,Emilia
'Can just spit'n most wounds to heal'em.,Garfiel
—It's a promise.,Emilia
"Um, what do we do with the fingers?",Emilia
Pinky promise if I lie swallow a thousand neeedles.,Subaru
Pinky promised!,Emilia
Seriously can't tell'f yer cool or yer awful.,Garfiel
Just an advocate of cautiousness.,Subaru
"Subaru. If you think it's dangerous, come back straight away.",Emilia
—huh?,Subaru
Wha—!?,Subaru
"Your, castle?",Subaru
"It wasn't good or bad, but what kind of tea was that?",Subaru
What the hell did you just make me drink!?,Subaru
"You didn't say anything so clever, stop smiling!",Subaru
"Um, no!?",Subaru
A dream? I haven't got your face down nearly well enough to be dreaming about it.,Subaru
O-On what basis are you...,Subaru
"...I honestly don't know. But, what you're saying's not wrong.",Subaru
I'm accepting that this is your dream for now at least. So how can I get out?,Subaru
"—! Then, you...",Subaru
Aren't... planning to let me out?,Subaru
With what.,Subaru
You... know the answers to the things I want to know?,Subaru
...Wha?,Subaru
"Eh, uh, ah? Wa, wait. E-Echidna? Where'd she go?",Subaru
...be something you could tell me... what?,Subaru
Nuh?,Subaru
—!?,Subaru
"Uawh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! A-arm... my aaaaaaaaaaaaaarm!?",Subaru
"Wh, what the hell.. a-are you...",Subaru
Pri...!?,Subaru
"Are you, a witch too? That kid before, and Echidna...",Subaru
"Will, my arm and legs... r, return to normal?",Subaru
...Boobs?,Subaru
A-are you crying?,Subaru
Whu?,Subaru
Bhuh—?,Subaru
"Hweh!? Uh, yesmaam!",Subaru
"Are there too. I can stand, walk, moonwalk!",Subaru
"Y-you really helped, thanks. But, just going with the conversation, you'd be...?",Subaru
Really now!,Subaru
"Don't say that like you're gonna kill everybody, it's scary!",Subaru
"No mistake, you are a witch. ...Humans don't think anything like this.",Subaru
"Nothing half-baked, so she's scary when she's mad?",Subaru
"Actually, I've been getting the feeling you're leaving the WITCH OF ENVY out in the cold.",Subaru
"...I feel like I just heard something I really can't let slide but, go on.",Subaru
"It's like you're a rabbit or something, where you can live forever by eating your own crap.",Subaru
Sizeable Hare?,Subaru
"Deterrent? For what pur... no, in opposition to what?",Subaru
As combat power for when the Witch of Envy's unsealed... huh.,Subaru
"Hm? Yeah, I did. Roswaal. What, you know him?",Subaru
"Unsatisfied with using only his own life, he might offer up his whole family's time?",Subaru
Even if it means cheating!,Subaru
But why!,Subaru
"Man, I don't really have much I want to ask you.",Subaru
"Ah, actually now that I think of it I just remembered a question.",Subaru
...s you were doing that would be...,Subaru
"...It doesn't exactly give a good impression, 'test site.' But you aren't denying it.",Subaru
That reminds me... I've heard your name somewhere before I came here.,Subaru
Puck.,Subaru
"—!? Yes, that one! He's a cat spirit. You know Puck?",Subaru
—ddaah!?,Subaru
"...eu, ah?",Subaru
"Yo, u... did, y... poison...",Subaru
"Ta, lking as if, you know...",Subaru
"Witch, Factor...?",Subaru
"When it's ha, rmonized what, ha...",Subaru
"Just, thought this...",Subaru
"What, are—",Subaru
"You said, it doesn't end unless you try to...",Subaru
"Don't just, do these things...!",Subaru
—!?,Subaru
"—Yeah, you really are a witch.",Subaru
"—You're right, is it just me that the way you guessed that was sooo terrifying?",Emilia
"How much of that was imagination, and how much of that was reality?",Subaru
"Ummm,",Subaru
"Mhm, what?",Emilia
I can't describe how sorry I am for making you worry. I got kinda carried away.,Subaru
"Auugh. I was really, really worried. You screamed and fainted right after you went in.",Emilia
"Nevermind the screaming, I fainted?",Subaru
"—Eh? Ohoh, well now ain't you up finally.",Garfiel
Wha—!?,Emilia
"I-I wasn't crying. I mean I was worried and panicked, but I wasn't really...",Emilia
"But it is. If he heard I was worried, that... that I was about to cry, he'd...",Emilia
"...somehow, I just knew you'd react like that.",Emilia
"My bad. Man, ain't this rare. Me sincerely recognizin' my screwups.",Garfiel
I am so sorry for not following your warning!,Subaru
Why couldn't you have just died.,Ram
Too straight!,Subaru
I'm not a masochist. That I keep stepping on landmines is just my nature!,Subaru
"Noooow then,",Roswaal
"Ow. Owie, Emilia-tan.",Subaru
"Your warning made nobody happy, Ram.",Subaru
"Incidentally, Emilia-sama... how was the cemetery?",Roswaal
Garfiel. Have the QUALIFICATIONS been confirmed?,Roswaal
The cemetery's lights?,Subaru
"Mischief, suuuuch as?",Roswaal
Pissing across the tomb's entrance or something. That'd get the cemetary's manager mad.,Subaru
"Buuuuut,",Roswaal
...Mana Gate frenzy.,Emilia
"Correct. Aaaand when you're me... well, it's a miiiiiracle I didn't burst.",Roswaal
"I, I mean yes, but... Doesn't that judgement of yourself hurt?",Emilia
After the Royal Selection's over and things've calmed down I'll think over it for you.,Emilia
So at least three years away!?,Subaru
"But,",Subaru
Being?,Subaru
It is a simple question. —Will you be willing to take the TRIAL?,Roswaal
Ain't the amazin' me. 'S this old hag.,Garfiel
"Uhmm, I think he uses 'loli' a lot with Beatrice... it means small, right?",Emilia
"By the way,",Subaru
Contracts again...,Subaru
"I'm the only one who can do it, is what it is.",Emilia
"No one at all until now? I'm terrified to ask but, Lewes how old are you.",Subaru
"Way more than enough! You're the oldest person I've met until now, at least.",Subaru
"Anyway, I understand the circumstances.",Emilia
I think it's sooo not good to rain on people's parades when they're motivated.,Emilia
"I have no idea that means. Subaru, sometimes you say things that're sooo bamboozling.",Emilia
Who says bamboozling anymore?,Subaru
"Nonono,",Subaru
"Set up, by who.",Emilia
Who? There's only one person who coulda.,Subaru
You!,Subaru
Ehh? My amazin' self?,Garfiel
"Er, no, sorry, I turned too far. Thiswaythiswaythisway—there, you, Roswaal.",Subaru
Nooooothing could've been sloppier.,Roswaal
"You know, I think I've got it.",Subaru
"That's... correct. Mhm, you're right.",Roswaal
"Myyyy gooooodness. Iiiiis this the image of me that's inside you, Subaru-kun?",Roswaal
"Meaning,",Subaru
Ain't it obvious?,Garfiel
And your problems are of course...,Subaru
"That we can't leave Sanctuary fer the outside werld, 'd be it.",Lewes
Me. —That's what's happening here.,Emilia
"You haven't done anything bad to the villagers, have you?",Emilia
Yoooou don't look satisfied.,Roswaal
"I forgot to mention this, but about the motive behind those injuries.",Subaru
"Mmhm mmhm, do go on. Iiiiii won't be grading you.",Roswaal
"It's a performance. No, it's an opening gambit.",Subaru
Hmm. Aaaaand what happens then?,Roswaal
"Lovely, thanks. Makes me wanna puke.",Subaru
"...Almost, the correct answer. That waaaasn't the only reason I entered the cemetery.",Roswaal
"It seems you don't quite understand the weight of Roswaal-sama's thanks, Barusu.",Ram
Roswaal-sama.,Ram
"Thaaaaat said,",Roswaal
"...Then, you mean you're conciliating?",Subaru
"I remember. Wouldn't forget it. ...Better I don't forget it, I think.",Subaru
"...I accept, gratefully. That is, so long at it gives those battles significance.",Subaru
"...Really, not just my power.",Subaru
"Now then,",Ram
Knew it.,Subaru
Resolve?,Subaru
"...Seriously, a blue moon.",Subaru
Naturally.,Roswaal
"Goodness, I'm so enthused but he just puuuuuushes me aside.",Roswaal
"Anyway,",Subaru
Precisely. You doooon't think there's value in that?,Roswaal
"Arguing with someone who gets angry at logic does pay off. Truuuuuuly, a good trend.",Roswaal
...Ram.,Subaru
You—!!,Subaru
"...You've fallen victim to this unintelligible crap because, Rem.",Subaru
"As you say, Roswaal-sama.",Ram
"What, are you goddamn getting at...",Subaru
Wha—?,Subaru
If you knew that then why the fuck—!,Subaru
Because I knew.,Roswaal
——wuh.,Subaru
Y-you... do you even understand what you're saying?,Subaru
—Am I now.,Subaru
"But, you defied that probability. —Are you perhaps unsatisfied?",Roswaal
You're not the type to make a bet in the first place. Why did you make one here?,Subaru
—Because I believed. In you.,Roswaal
So you're not gonna answer me seriously.,Subaru
...It seems our conversation for today will be eeeeeeending here.,Roswaal
Aaauhg!,Subaru
You truly are worthy as my co-conspirator—Mmhm.,Roswaal
...The death you're getting won't be anything nice.,Subaru
"I won't let that happen. She... Emilia, will I protect.",Subaru
—That's what I have to do in this SANCTUARY.,Subaru
—Was that truly to your liking?,Ram
There is no need to speak lies before me.,Ram
Roswaal-sama. Here.,Ram
"Anyhow,",Roswaal
"Then, what you said to Barusu was...",Ram
I kinda don't get how the people here really feel about this tomb.,Subaru
"Please do tell me, Mr. Obfuscates-Explanations-With-Tenable-Words!",Otto
Circumstances are circumstances. Here I'll lend you the rope.,Subaru
But I'm the one lending you!?,Otto
"He's forgotten that I am literally holding his lifeline, this man.",Otto
"Natsuki-san, go whenever you'd like, but please give a signal saying when you are going.",Otto
"Right, going.",Subaru
"Compared to being on the brink of living and dying, this is so much less awful—!",Subaru
"My foot is, properly, on the ground. It didn't crumble.",Subaru
"He stresses a complex and unnecessary pride, this man!",Otto
—oh,Subaru
Oh...,Otto
"...The lights have turned on. What are the conditions for this, exactly?",Otto
That's incredibly terrifying!,Otto
"As a human being you should be embarrassed by that, that logic!",Otto
"He sure is a pain, that Yoohororoi. When I next see him I'll be sure to let him know.",Subaru
Wueeeuh?,Otto
"Well,",Subaru
"Yer goin' back to the cathedral. Then, I'll see ya off 'till there.",Garfiel
That's what'm sayin' I'm tellin' ya.,Garfiel
"Pisses me off shamin' my group, but the people livin' in Sanctuary ain't a single monolith.",Garfiel
What do you mean by that?,Subaru
You mean... there's a chance they could aim their designs at me and Otto?,Subaru
I have to get back now!,Subaru
...Eh?,Garfiel
"'S no way that'd be it. Coincidence. 'S coincidence, 'm sayin'.",Garfiel
Holy hell you're so easy.,Subaru
He got me!!,Otto
But I'm pretty damn easy too.,Subaru
"Night comes, and it really does feel like a tomb. It looks creepier than yesterday.",Emilia
Do you think it's fine to go in yet?,Emilia
"Right. Then, I suppose I'll go.",Emilia
What're you mumbling about? It's kinda making me sooo curious.,Emilia
Auuugh it's too EMK (Emilia-tan Maji Kishidou).,Subaru
"Ah, I feel it's been a while since I've heard you say that.",Emilia
But you'll swoon if you come in.,Emilia
"But,",Emilia
The way you're wiggling your fingers's creepy so no.,Emilia
"—This time, I really am going. Pray that I'll come back safely.",Emilia
I'll be praying so hard the Bhudda's ears spurt blood.,Subaru
"Yer look down, squert.",Lewes
You know the Trial's contents?,Subaru
The cemetery lights're out!?,Subaru
"They're meant ter stay on while the TRIAL's going, but...",Lewes
Then this's an irregular development?,Subaru
Lil' Su!? Yer won't get ter enter without the qualifications...,Lewes
—Emilia!!,Subaru
hdmfsiudfmhsdifhsjdkf!!,Subaru
"Ghak, eughgkk, expecting way too... much of a sleeping opponent... or, what.",Subaru
"What're you doing grabbing someone's leg while sayin... hey, wa- ahh! Agugughguh!",Subaru
"Mom. I know you said you worked hard on this for me, but...",Subaru
That's enough for now.,Subaru
"Even if Armageddon came, I absolutely would not eat peas.",Subaru
"I always wonder this, but what's with the east-west blend?",Subaru
"Dad's here in the morning, so he's probably the one who made the soup and toast.",Subaru
"Oh, yeah,",Subaru
Isn't doing that pointless when it isn't cold out?,Subaru
Weren't you just trying to make people overcome their pickiness!?,Subaru
"I'm not misunderstanding anything here, you're just getting less and less credible!",Subaru
"Nnywell, the wife's responsibility is the husband's to take, so dad eat these.",Subaru
"This's some concern that made nobody happy, this green plate!",Subaru
Thanks for the meal.,Subaru
"Wh, at?",Subaru
"Why? Why, why did that turn strange?",Subaru
"So, there's nothing I can do. Right, there's nothing.",Subaru
"...Usually, this'd calm me down. So why?",Subaru
"Calm down, calm down... time's already up. It's okay to calm down now. It's okay.",Subaru
"Why, just today...",Subaru
Something's strange. What is it? Did something happen? Yesterday I...,Subaru
Don't just come up with these ideas and set aside realistic time for them! And I'm fine!,Subaru
"Talk? You mean, telling me to at least wash my own dishes?",Subaru
—Ow.,Subaru
"S, so? My unmotivated dad's here to talk with me.",Subaru
—This's middle school!!,Subaru
You said that when I was still attached to the umbilical cord...,Subaru
So?,Subaru
As if I could have a friendly chat with some old stranger.,Subaru
So...,Subaru
"When it's my father, there's a chance he might even find that shame funny...",Subaru
"Really now, don't believe it at all. ...I guess, I'll pass it though.",Subaru
When you're 17 hearing that question is nothing but terrifying!!,Subaru
"Ahh, right right, happy happy. ...You really are just joking though, right?",Subaru
Sounds like this fence is your and Ikeda or whoever's fault.,Subaru
Someone who sends cards that incessantly's hardly off the map...,Subaru
Haha. I would get that a lot. Especially about the eyes.,Subaru
"...Yes, I suppose.",Subaru
—hk!,Subaru
...There's no such thing as a vending machine that fills things with love. Thanks.,Subaru
...Tricky to say.,Subaru
I seriously can't believe you can get email addresses that fast.,Subaru
Categorize it like that and I'm a target too!,Subaru
"I don't, no! You're the one who should be getting asked what the heck they're saying!!",Subaru
"Don't piggyback me, don't haveta go back. ...Since if I do go back, it'll be with you.",Subaru
I'm getting lectured by my own damn body.,Subaru
—huh?,Subaru
"It's not conversation stuffing... seriously, what was that?",Subaru
I do think... it's bad of me.,Subaru
...Why.,Subaru
"My face, got better?",Subaru
"...That's, what it should be. I did surf the grand waves the internet yesterday though.",Subaru
So you're even doing that...,Subaru
—gghuahh!,Subaru
"Ahh... yeah, I'm okay. Just, a little dizzy...",Subaru
—!?,Subaru
You're...,Subaru
"Sorry, for worrying you. I'm okay now.",Subaru
"Yeah, I'm sorry. And, about that question from before.",Subaru
"—There is somebody I like. So I'm, okay now.",Subaru
I've got somebody I like. Even though it's me.,Subaru
I do. I'm not some brat who just curls up into a little ball in his room anymore.,Subaru
I wanted you or mom to slap me.,Subaru
I was the only one left around me.,Subaru
Adauuadh!?,Subaru
Uuueguh,Subaru
You don't even get villains like that in shonen manga anymore! That's ridiculous!,Subaru
I'm not that slow or dumb or idiotic...,Subaru
Redundancy.,Subaru
Presumption.,Subaru
Then you should've stopped time last year when you got hit by that car.,Subaru
"Ow! Aaaugow! Wai, my wrists's.... Owww!",Subaru
"...I told you. I've got somebody I, like.",Subaru
"And, there's someone who told me that they, liked, ones like me.",Subaru
You only just did something more painful to me than a slap!,Subaru
Right there?,Subaru
"Wait, wait, wait...",Subaru
Then what even was all that time I spent stagnant...,Subaru
It's completely true but it's amazing how little I wanna accept it now!,Subaru
Just half? Genius's something that gets more refined with each generation.,Subaru
"I'm sorry mom, I have no counter to that!",Subaru
"Ah, yeah. Umm, I caused so much trouble for you and I'm..",Subaru
"—guueh,",Subaru
...I—I'm so sorry.,Subaru
"I'm sor—sorr, so, sorry—I, sorry, s-sorry—soh, ree... hk,",Subaru
"I'mso, sorry... I—I... you two, any more... so—I'm so, sorry...",Subaru
"—Yeah. Sorry. I really, just cause so many problems.",Subaru
...What a parent and child our age were up to together'd be a story in itself.,Subaru
That line can be fatal depending who you're saying it to so be careful how you use it.,Subaru
"So,",Subaru
I'll be going home ahead. Try not to get interrogated or whatever.,Subaru
Don't prompt them.,Subaru
"—Yeah. Leave it to me, dad.",Subaru
"Well, not like truants go walking around under the dazzling Mister Sun often.",Subaru
—I'm home.,Subaru
...I'm home.,Subaru
"When I didn't get a reply after saying 'I'm home,' I was worried something'd happened.",Subaru
"It's not like I could ever win in a footrace with dad anywa... or no, actually...",Subaru
"In the end, I was taking half-measures with damn everything.",Subaru
What? Something funny?,Subaru
"Feels like I'll wind up staying if I keep being here too long, so...",Subaru
"So hey, there's sorta something I wanna ask you.",Subaru
—Do you remember where I put my school uniform?,Subaru
"Student Natsuki Subaru, complete... Been like three months.",Subaru
"It's the last time, so should I have it perfect, or just have it how I always do it?",Subaru
My mom's robbing me of said temper with that 'right now'!,Subaru
"Right now, I'm not really in the...",Subaru
"Wh, what makes you...",Subaru
"Um, that'd be the world...",Subaru
...How long have you been thinking that?,Subaru
I'm despairing at the height of this hurdle you're asking.,Subaru
Thus dubbed Super Family Complex aka Super Famicom—augh just shut up.,Subaru
Triple sevens. Mind putting this cap in my closet afterwards?,Subaru
Literally love in a different multitude!,Subaru
"Now... well, bout time to go.",Subaru
Looking at my outfit could you please use your imagination a little before speaking!?,Subaru
Wha!? But this feels like you're asking me to come with you!?,Subaru
Nonono... give me a break here. Come on.,Subaru
Really? Feels like we go to buy things at night together like all the time.,Subaru
"The big points were... the story about Ikeda-san, and some tales of the past I guess.",Subaru
Uh that's kinda the first time I'm hearing of the tragic development in that second half!?,Subaru
"M, mom... how much about me, do you...",Subaru
"The mayonnaise, and why I was a shut-in, too...",Subaru
They're amazing girls. They seriously are wasted on me.,Subaru
"Am I really, made from him properly? Can I really, be his son properly?",Subaru
So you know your genes making up my body are inferior!?,Subaru
"A woman's heart sent wavering by her husband and son, is this erotica?",Subaru
Guh—bwaaah!?,Subaru
"That was full of good vibes, but I'm kinda bleeding, here.",Subaru
"Me being like me, huh.",Subaru
"Scars deep enough to warrant that worrying... actually were there, yeah.",Subaru
Mom!,Subaru
Ah...,Subaru
There's something I have to do. This goodbye'll be a long one.,Subaru
...I-it's okay?,Subaru
You know? ...how? ...hk,Subaru
"T-this... childish... so, lame...",Subaru
Not what I... mean...,Subaru
"...I'm sorry, mom. I'm, ultimately, still without doing anything for you...",Subaru
"...Yeah, it is.",Subaru
...I'm impressed you can say that while referencing your own face.,Subaru
We're just talking about faces here though but okay!,Subaru
"Ahhhgeez, all this crying's so damn pathetic.",Subaru
"You mean, if the results're good then everything's okay?",Subaru
"—I'll be going, then.",Subaru
—See you later!,Subaru
"First, got something I just wanna say.",Subaru
That uniform looks great on you.,Subaru
"Um, your face... close...",Subaru
"And that's, the point of this TRIAL?",Subaru
"Every bit of it.. then, you saw me crying with snot trailing out my nose, too!?",Subaru
"Shut up!! Don't tell anyone, it's too embarrassing!",Subaru
Huh?,Subaru
"Ah... so that's it. If that's it, then yeah my condolences.",Subaru
If you only took out information needed for this TRIAL.. then why take out the uniform...,Subaru
Are you one of those idiot geniuses?,Subaru
Really doesn't need asking though. This world really is...,Subaru
"Don't look down on my parents out of petty revenge, witch.",Subaru
Praise me and I'll blush.,Subaru
"Right then, do have one.",Subaru
"Say, Echidna.",Subaru
Thank you.,Subaru
"And I'm grateful for that. So, thank you.",Subaru
"Isn't that convenient. —Well, see you next TRIAL then.",Subaru
...I've already been told everything that's important.,Subaru
"Ghheugck! Ptooptoo! Weird, rock in my mouth... oueehgghh",Subaru
"Right, I took the TRIAL...",Subaru
It's okay. I didn't forget. I remember everything I told them.,Subaru
"Right! I came in here because, Emilia!",Subaru
"...hk. ...n, no... sto...",Emilia
——hk,Emilia
"Emilia!? Hey, get a hold of... Emilia!",Subaru
"—u, baru?",Emilia
"We didn't, discuss that far...",Emilia
Uhhh... wha? Why am I...?,Emilia
"ah, uh, mm.",Emilia
In a dark place... alone with Subaru...,Emilia
"Ri, ght... I, took the TRIAL, and...",Emilia
"a, nn, no, that, I, I didn't... mean to... tha....",Emilia
Emilia?,Subaru
"I, it wasn't, me... no. I, I didn't, do it... but, I told you, I, no...",Emilia
"Emilia. Hold on, Emilia? Calm down, what's...",Subaru
It's okay. You're okay. I'm with you. I'm here. You're not alone. It's okay.,Subaru
"...lp, dad. He, lp... Puck, Puck... pahkk...",Emilia
—She's been calmed down and put to bed.,Ram
"Sloppy or whatever's none of your business... I'm sorry, for worrying you.",Subaru
"Um, excuse me,",Otto
"Nononononono, wait a moment here.",Otto
"Uh, yeah, yes, I have taken it. A friend signed me up for it so had no choice.",Subaru
"It's clearly impossible that you would have friends, please be more serious, Natsuki-san.",Otto
"You know, there's things that're okay and not okay to say to people!",Subaru
"Then, you have taken the TRIAL, Barusu. Correct?",Ram
"You deceived us, now die.",Ram
Conclusion and punishment're too fast!!,Subaru
Put a hold on that blather pouring from your mouth... How do you know this?,Ram
Because the Trial's concocter the—,Subaru
I can't get it out what that person was like at all...,Subaru
Understand what?,Subaru
"Uh, uh-huh... right.",Subaru
"Well then,",Otto
The contents... Would it be alright for me to ask you about them?,Otto
"I, I see... and that's why the particulars would differ.",Otto
So inevitably everyone who could beat the TRIAL'd be distressed. That's black-hearted.,Subaru
"You're never gonna succeed as a merchant, but I'm thankful man.",Subaru
Why are you abruptly crushing people's dreams!?,Otto
"I'm too shy to give an honest thanks without throwing a joke in, try feeling a little.",Subaru
How about you try feeling a little just how deeply you wounded my heart!!,Otto
"Um... I'm sorry, for causing trouble.",Emilia
"Thank goodness, good morning. Does your body and stuff feel okay now, Emilia-tan?",Subaru
"ah. Yeah, I'm fine. My body has nothing off at all. Sorry for making you worry.",Emilia
"—yeah, you're right.",Emilia
Hm?,Subaru
"ah, uh... I-I'm fine. That's not it. I'm just kinda um, still half-asleep.",Emilia
Hey. You're making it sound like Emilia-tan's hesitating to speak with me sincerely.,Subaru
"Well I'd really like to show that consideration, but...",Subaru
"Ah, uh!",Emilia
Who says dandy anymore?,Subaru
"Hmp, you're doing that again, Subaru.",Emilia
"Emilia-sama. I am aware that you have only just awoken, but regarding the TRIAL...",Ram
—hk,Emilia
"Right... umm, does everyone know about the TRIAL's content?",Emilia
"If yer sayin' 'evening' you know it means when ya fainted and got carried here, yeah?",Garfiel
'D be funny t'see Roswaal burst tryin' t'test that.,Garfiel
Babble. That's sure cruel.,Subaru
"Overcame it... Subaru did? He, the TRIAL?",Emilia
"Did you truly pass it, Subaru? That... past?",Emilia
"N-no. It, didn't... I tried my best, but it suddenly got interrupted half way though.",Emilia
Me?,Subaru
M-me?,Emilia
"If for assumption you're unable to take the TRIAL, I'll take it instead.",Subaru
"—!? But Subaru, that's...",Emilia
"Why you're... y-you mean, for me?",Emilia
Exactly.,Subaru
Why are you doing... so much for me?,Emilia
"Didn't I tell you? Because I love you, super love you.",Subaru
"Subaru you, idiot.",Emilia
Huh? What? I didn't hear that last one. I love you sooo much?,Subaru
No! It was thank you sooo much...,Emilia
Got it. I heard it but let's have it one more time!,Subaru
Subaru you idiot!!,Emilia
"I don't have one left, and that gives me a chance to nag a reward out of you.",Subaru
"With me and Emilia-tan's loveydovey power, this TRIAL'll be a breeze.",Subaru
Dun'care. Either way 'sdone things'll turn goddamn nothin' nice fer me.,Garfiel
Imposing on everyone's feelings like that isn't gonna hold out for long.,Subaru
"Honestly, I got nothing. Just what to do about this...",Subaru
Yer ain't lookin' much surprised. That threat really do nothin'?,Garfiel
You were lookin' for my amazin' self?,Garfiel
"Yeah,",Subaru
That's not an 'is all'! That's something crazy serious!,Subaru
"...Ugh. Oi, yer just made most all'a 'em get away, whatt'm I gonna do now?",Garfiel
Change of pace...,Garfiel
"So, that change 'a pace 'er whatever really workin' out fer you?",Garfiel
Meaning?,Subaru
I don't know what you'd mean by 'pointless struggle'...,Subaru
"Look. Bein' honest, whatddya think? Let's cut th' belly open on this n' talk.",Garfiel
That's...,Subaru
—I have a proposal.,Subaru
'M I gonna get to hear it?,Garfiel
"Well, 's that.",Garfiel
"What the heck are you saying, looking so satisfied.",Subaru
"Right, then let me oblige..",Subaru
"—But, I gotta condition.",Garfiel
"...It's got pros for you too. The food, and avoids infighting.",Subaru
...What's the condition?,Subaru
"Makes things quick,",Garfiel
"—! Wait, that can't be right. If I do that, then everything from the start's...",Subaru
"—'Sides, is it really necessary t' overcome the past in the first place?",Garfiel
Wha?,Subaru
"Can't watch, what...?",Subaru
Emilia absolutely will overcome the TRIAL for us. So we...,Subaru
Emilia's... will...,Subaru
"What I saw was. I faced my PAST, sorted it out, and was glad I did. But, Emilia..",Subaru
"—Su, bahru?",Emilia
Emilia-tan.,Subaru
Emilia.,Subaru
Ah...,Emilia
I-I...,Emilia
Suhbarhu...,Emilia
"Natsuki-san, preparations on my end are complete. All that's left is to depart.",Otto
"Thank you. If you hadn't told me, Subaru, I, mightn't have even noticed this.",Emilia
"Yeah,",Emilia
"I know. I'm depending on you, Subaru. So...",Emilia
"So then, what're you saying?",Subaru
"Crap, heartflutter.",Subaru
"ＯＫＯＫ, got it. I'll come back to your side quickly and moreover, safely. Pinky promise?",Subaru
"The 'if I lie' one, you did with Petra? ...okay, got it. Let's.",Emilia
"Ohoho, so honest.",Subaru
"Subaru. For practitioners of the spiritual arts, promises are...",Emilia
"But even so, I'm surprised.",Otto
Nnha?,Subaru
Were you just asleep?,Otto
"What are those, those eyes that look like they're seeing someone suspicious?",Otto
"Hey, hear that, Patrasche? This guy sitting next to me's saying I'll be a god.",Subaru
"N'matter where y'two go yer never damn change, oi.",Garfiel
"That reminds me,",Subaru
"For volunteering to be the guide, you're not doing very much leading. Quit your post?",Subaru
"Hell're y'two doin',",Garfiel
Why are opinions of me so set in going in that direction!?,Otto
That's...,Otto
"Are you all right with this, Natsuki-san?",Otto
"'All right with this' in what meaning, exactly?",Subaru
Huh? Really? You haven't met him yet?,Subaru
Password?,Subaru
Uh? What? Byebye gullymorry?,Subaru
"Anyway, if we say this we'll be let through, yeah?",Subaru
"...Right, you did mention this before.",Subaru
"'S the granny's requestin' me, don't worry 'bout it. M're importantly, well,",Garfiel
"Ehh,",Garfiel
"When yer back't th' damn mansion, 's Frederica gonna be there?",Garfiel
"Yeah, she should be there. Right, it did sound like you knew her. What's with that?",Subaru
I'll tell her you were worried. She'll probably have something to say back.,Subaru
...I ain't askin' yer to.,Garfiel
"Yeah, you relax! My power for keeping promises's been amazing lately!",Subaru
"Ass hurts from sitting so much... but, I'm glad.",Subaru
"Are we returning immediately to SANCTUARY, Natsuki-san?",Otto
"Nah,",Subaru
"Ah, that's right. Yes, I also have things I need to discuss with my fellow merchants.",Otto
"Discuss with your fellow merchants, being?",Subaru
"Just what I expected of you, Natsuki-san. You understand!",Otto
"Otto sorted the papers, but it's probably multiplied again over this week.",Subaru
Apologies for the late-night visit. I'm here from the fire statiooon—huh.,Subaru
No reply.,Subaru
"Heeeey, I'm hoooome. Food! Bath! Sleep!",Subaru
I'll apologize... is also pretty weird idea. I don't feel there's something I did wrong...,Subaru
"First's the prelims... is what I was thinking, but...",Subaru
"Right. There's a hidden passage here. I remember, I remember that.",Subaru
"Puck froze me solid, I think.",Subaru
But why is it...,Subaru
What were they running from?,Subaru
"Frederica and Petra probably left the mansion. ...then, I'll,",Subaru
The Beatrice I know's not the kind of brat who can read that mood.,Subaru
I'll pull her out!,Subaru
And if that much is given—!,Subaru
Ddweh?,Subaru
—Wha?,Subaru
...uubbg,Subaru
Ueuegh! Oeue! Ubggelgh!,Subaru
"Inside the, tomb?",Subaru
"Right after the first TRIAL? Came back this far... no, more importantly,",Subaru
Emilia!,Subaru
I already know this attempt won't work...,Subaru
"Suh, bahru?",Emilia
"Yeah, that's right. It's me, Emilia-tan. Are you okay?",Subaru
"But either way... again, huh?",Subaru
This's seriously where the GUTHUNTER makes her reappearance... gimme a break...,Subaru
"Why Elsa was in the mansion, and what happened to Frederica and Petra.",Subaru
"At least, nothing had happened until that night... maybe?",Subaru
"Above Julius, below Wilhelm-san... or about.",Subaru
After seeing the other candidates... doesn't feel you can fully assert that.,Subaru
"Nothing,",Subaru
"Just had some things I wanted to sort out, did some thinking. Emilia?",Subaru
"Dunno who he is, but this Mororok dozes too much.",Subaru
"Hey, Garfiel.",Subaru
Nnwhet?,Garfiel
"You're the strongest, aren't you. You're confident you wouldn't lose to anyone, right?",Subaru
Wha?,Garfiel
"Prove those words to me. This, is the thing which feels most reliable.",Subaru
"Barusu, Emilia-sama is still...",Ram
"Um... I'm so sorry, for causing so many problems. Inside the tomb, and now...",Emilia
"Mm. It feels like I hit my hip when I fell down, it's kind of tingly...",Emilia
"So, would you be well? If there are no issues, then...",Ram
"Ri-right. I'm okay. We have to... talk about the TRIAL, right.",Emilia
"Then, just why is Natsuki-san alright after entering the tomb?",Otto
"...Mhm, meaning?",Ram
"Whawh, please wait, Natsuki-san.",Otto
"Idiot, Otto.",Subaru
What did you just say?,Emilia
"Let's calm down, Emilia-tan. That was, um...",Subaru
"Don't cover it up, tell me. —Please, Subaru.",Emilia
"...That was, it. You knew, Subaru?",Emilia
"No, I had completely not at all noticed it until someone told me.",Subaru
...Subaru.,Emilia
Tomorrow?,Emilia
Wha—!?,Subaru
"Of all people, how the hell are you the one saying this?",Subaru
Why are you talking like a kid!,Subaru
Lewes-san...,Subaru
...Subaru.,Emilia
"Subaru, you...",Emilia
"Subaru, you... you also... can't leave this to me?",Emilia
...Wha?,Subaru
No. That's not it.,Subaru
You don't have to remember it!,Subaru
"Shut up! You... you don't know anything yet, so you...",Subaru
Ohh?,Garfiel
...I got no idea what yer sayin' all a sudden.,Garfiel
"What, do... you know, Subaru?",Emilia
Emilia?,Subaru
"No... No,",Emilia
"You know? Subaru, you, do you, know... my, PAST?",Emilia
"Wait, let's calm down. Take deep breaths. The conversation's going somewhere bad. So,",Subaru
"N-no... I, didn't mean to... I, just... just...",Emilia
"Emilia, what're...",Subaru
—Ram.,Subaru
Please excuse me.,Ram
...ah,Emilia
What was that?,Subaru
"A swift method for calming her down. Would you be mad, Barusu?",Ram
I'm not trying to...,Subaru
"'F she's gonna need babysittin', the talk ends here.",Garfiel
"Convenient, which means...",Subaru
"So element a Otto, how do you see this situation?",Subaru
Emilia-sama is incapable of overcoming the TRIAL?,Ram
That's being way too patient.,Subaru
Do you believe Garf may cull from the villagers?,Ram
"You know she'll be wounded, but force her to walk on. Quite an oni you are.",Ram
"Having an oni tell me that makes me an unusual one, too. Just... no, nevermind.",Subaru
"Ram. After Emilia's settled in the bedroom, I wanna talk to Roswaal. Can I?",Subaru
Roswaal-sama is in the midst of recuperation. Nobody may enter his room for a time.,Ram
"Stand watch, Otto.",Ram
Most certainly!,Otto
"Now, you're welcome to take Emilia-sama to the bed. If you'd like any help...",Otto
"Before that, what's with this submissive attitude you've got toward Ram?",Subaru
Ah...,Subaru
"Wait for me, Emilia.",Subaru
"—Iiiiiii see, I do coooooomprehend the situation.",Roswaal
"So? What is it you waaaaant to do with me, Subaru-kun?",Roswaal
And whaaaaat would that mean?,Roswaal
Noooow then. Is that all the business you haaaaave with me?,Roswaal
"No, there's more. —We haven't had the vital, vital conversation yet.",Subaru
"Hooooowever,",Roswaal
"Elf? Not a half-elf? ...no, I don't think I have.",Subaru
Right?,Roswaal
"So, either way elves have a past of being oppressed.",Subaru
"Iiiiiiin suuuuuum,",Roswaal
"That's... agreed. But, how does this tie into it?",Subaru
"It's frozen solid, and nobody can get near it...",Subaru
"All except the single half-elf girl, who committed the slip.",Roswaal
You regret asking... doooo you?,Roswaal
"Just, a bit surprised. How to say... Emilia's a little older than me than I thought.",Subaru
"Do you reeeeeeegret that you asked me, and think you shouldn't have?",Roswaal
...You really are unpleasant.,Subaru
"Then, could I really face a past where I froze a bunch of people solid...",Subaru
Is it certain that Emilia froze the forest... that she the froze the elf village?,Subaru
"Wroooooong, you don't understaaaaaaaand, you muuuuuuuustn't, Subaru-kun.",Roswaal
You... what the hell are you thinking?,Subaru
Hmmmmmmhm.,Roswaal
—Of course I do.,Roswaal
"Rohz, wahl?",Subaru
"Ser... no, nevermind.",Subaru
—Subaru-kun.,Roswaal
You did get the qualifications?,Roswaal
"...Choose the optimum, Subaru-kun.",Roswaal
What?,Subaru
"Wha... this's nothing like you. What's with this, Roz-chi.",Subaru
Good night.,Subaru
"...You wouldn't have burdened Roswaal-sama, correct?",Ram
Do you mean to say I am not cute?,Ram
"Nope, if we just take your looks I'd say you're super crazy cute.",Subaru
"I can tell that was not a compliment, so this is how I'll react, Barusu.",Ram
...What did you just say?,Subaru
Tomb and how to face it is what I recommend you consider.,Ram
No. A little before that.,Subaru
Do you mean to say I am not cute?,Ram
"Wow that went back! ...you said, Echidna's tomb, right?",Subaru
What was she doing... goddamn putting blocks on people's memories...,Subaru
"Call it imperfect or half-assed... either way, the ban's lifted!",Subaru
Barusu?,Ram
"Y'dun gettit, oi.",Garfiel
I'm not thinking of anything that wild. Just kinda planning out a different approach.,Subaru
Yer plottin'.,Garfiel
I'm plotting.,Subaru
"Real sorry, abs'lutely not. Yer are, absolutely, not gettin' in this tomb.",Garfiel
You're even fucking saying that... just what the hell about me is pissing you off?!,Subaru
—Yer stink.,Garfiel
—auh?,Subaru
"The witch's, stink...",Subaru
"That, witch's stink thing...",Subaru
Ah?,Garfiel
"In the end, can't avert my eyes to this, either...",Subaru
"But,",Garfiel
More annoying...,Subaru
"...At least take baths, so Ram won't hate you.",Subaru
Let's not.,Subaru
Here's my payback for ignoring the damn tea party...,Subaru
"But tonight's useless, at least. Have to, take some measures...",Subaru
Elsa attacks the mansion. I lose the chance to repel Elsa right from under me.,Subaru
"Wait, wait, wait... Isn't this situation just plain bad?",Subaru
"But even if I recruit helpers... with these conditions, neither Ram or Otto're on my side.",Subaru
Then we won't make it in time for the attack. There something... anything I can do?,Subaru
...Just what should I do with you?,Subaru
"You believe that Natsuki Subaru's courage, will save Emilia!",Subaru
"Hey, good morning. 'Nother fresh morning today.",Subaru
Augh no embarrassing,Subaru
Echidna... huh. Just getting less and less apparent what that witch's goal is.,Subaru
"For that to change, the biggest obstacle is... yeah, it's probably Garfiel.",Subaru
"...And of course, I was expecting way too much with that opportunism.",Subaru
You're sure putting in work early in the morning.,Subaru
"I figured Garfiel'd be here, but I didn't expect to see you here, Lewes-san. Good morning.",Subaru
"Nnr, is a nice morning. Are yer going on a stroll too, Lil' Su?",Lewes
You...,Garfiel
"'Too', then you're out on a stroll, Lewes-san?",Subaru
"Have you known eachother long, Garfiel and Lewes?",Subaru
"Least since Lil' Gar wers small.. he's still small now, though.",Lewes
"Oi, look'ere granny. 'V far overshot yer height, yeah?",Garfiel
Going from your phrasing... Garfiel hasn't been in SANCTUARY since he was born?,Subaru
"—Granny, don't say anythin' unneeded more than that.",Garfiel
"Who're yer speakin' ter with that kinda lip, yer moron.",Lewes
Aaauow!,Garfiel
Gr-granny the hell're you doin' all sudden...,Garfiel
"Sto—ow, au, we're, we're bein' watch, aug,",Garfiel
"Tch, got leaked.",Subaru
"So I ain't movin' from this spot fer a while. Granny, food.",Garfiel
"It'll be hard to do something about these conditions... Nothing for it, I'll come back again.",Subaru
"Lil' Gar's dern with his food, so. I wanna talk with yer a bit, Lil' Su.",Lewes
Want me to give you a piggyback?,Subaru
And there's another amazing statement showing the appearance gap!,Subaru
Yer look like yer thinking of something erhverwhelmingly stupid.,Lewes
"This granny, keeps showing off her granny appeal one-after-another...",Subaru
Huh?,Subaru
"Hm,",Lewes
Something not sitting right with yer?,Lewes
"What, Lil' Su, yer mullin' over more than yer looks would say.",Lewes
This's super lonely. Why are you staying out here?,Subaru
"Yer speak for yerself, should pay mer concern to what exactly yer saying.",Lewes
"That sure was a specific and complicated expression I just made, huh!",Subaru
Why're there shields here? And two of them?,Subaru
Lil' Gar's things. Using the place as a derned storehouse.,Lewes
But what kind of battle can you have with just shields?,Subaru
"Yeah, just tastes like leaves.",Subaru
—Frederica.,Subaru
"The name of the person Garfiel butted shields with was Frederica, right?",Subaru
...Did Lil' Gar tell yer?,Lewes
Their fangs're way too similar. Not even the Buddha would permit this be unrelated.,Subaru
"...ahh, I swear. I can't think of anything to say ter refute that.",Lewes
"—But they've had their disagreements, and've wound up on differing paths.",Lewes
To what extent are you willing to answer my questions?,Subaru
"I can tell from your phrasing you're already giving me hints, but... strict command, huh.",Subaru
"That went by mighty easy, again.",Lewes
"Well then,",Lewes
I don't feel there's too many topics left I could talk ter yer about...,Lewes
Aug scary,Subaru
I can't agree with me terning into the villain from that.,Lewes
"Hrm, how so?",Lewes
"A side-road... yer sayin'. So, if yer find out about it, what'll you do?",Lewes
Right?,Subaru
"Well, I'm crazy in love with her.",Subaru
Are yer accepting it er not...,Lewes
"...Even so, the only one who gets to face their most painful heart is the person themself.",Lewes
Gracious... ain't that beyond the peak of loving someone egocentrically.,Lewes
"Neither herbivore nor carnivore, call me the omnivore male!",Subaru
"Those were sure some pretty words yer lined up, in that excuse of yers to be wily.",Lewes
Heheh!,Subaru
"It's weird with me sayin' it but, that sure didn't discourage yer, Lil' Su.",Lewes
"Snap outta that,",Subaru
Whu?,Subaru
Would you have perhaps just proclaimed that you have never taken the TRIAL?,Subaru
Yer got five minutes.,Lewes
—Wha?,Subaru
"If one of them is true, which one should I believe?",Subaru
There's some reason she couldn't do that... maybe she's started going senile...,Subaru
Did yer just try finalising a rather rude theory towards me?,Lewes
So did yer get an answer outter that conversation with yer heart or whatsit?,Lewes
Worried?,Lewes
"Yeah,",Subaru
"—Ah, so that's it.",Lewes
"Lil' Su, I'll tell yer some advice. As something special.",Lewes
Advice?,Subaru
"You can't tell, lies?",Subaru
Um...,Subaru
"Okay, I won't ask more. Let's change the topic. To something else.",Subaru
"Hrm. Then, allow me ter wait with expectations.",Lewes
"Wuou, pressure,",Subaru
Yer not too bad.,Lewes
"Made it myself but leaves're still leaves. Also, so about changing the topic...",Subaru
"Alright, so I'll be obliging.",Subaru
"Is there anything that Garfiel's weak to or hates, or things he'd faint at just by seeing?",Subaru
"Lil' Su, are yer aware that yer way of devoting yerself is a tidge crooked?",Lewes
"Tomorrow, I'll wind up having to not be there.",Subaru
"This time, the guy who raised that condition absolutely hates me...",Subaru
"What's wrong, Subaru?",Emilia
But how she said she'd do it without any complaining was really Emilia-tan.,Subaru
"Umm... that's no, don't.",Emilia
"That's sooo creepy. ...But, stay here.",Emilia
...Hm?,Emilia
"Nothing. Just thinking 'Emilia-tan's eyelashes're so long and cute, wanna eat 'em.'",Subaru
It's sorta the biggest expression of love you can give where I come from.,Subaru
—Subaru.,Emilia
What is it?,Subaru
"ah... m, sorry. No. Just, calling.",Emilia
"I, have to go soon, so...",Emilia
"—I have to go to the tomb. Subaru, you'll be there until partway.",Emilia
"—It's pointless. That's nooo good, Subaru.",Emilia
"So,",Emilia
"Mm, I will.",Emilia
"Oi, Lil' Su. There's some guy I don't know 'ere, who's that, this guy.",Lewes
That's what my position is to you!?,Otto
This's what he says after leaving people's stomachs ripped open... guy's beyond help.,Subaru
"If I'm beyond help then by your accompanying you're well beyond help, too!",Otto
"I'll be working you from now on too, so good to have you, Otto!",Subaru
"What the heck is he saying with such a sunny expression, this man!",Otto
"—So, see you soon, Emilia-tan.",Subaru
"Mm, take care.",Emilia
"Right... right. Mm, if that's what you say, Subaru...",Emilia
"Ram, I don't mean that as a reminder but...",Subaru
I'm in your debt... is terrifying actually. I'll thank you some other way.,Subaru
Tch. Unexpectedly good intuition from Barusu.,Ram
I just casually avoided a death flag there—hk,Subaru
"Natsuki-san? Now is about time for departure, shall we go?",Otto
"We shall. Lewes-san, escort pleaaase!",Subaru
Leave it all ter me.,Lewes
"But still, everyone looks good, knowing they can go back.",Subaru
"Really, huh?",Subaru
"Do you love SANCTUARY too, Lewes-san?",Subaru
Frightening?,Subaru
It's terrerrble. How barren people's hearts have become.,Lewes
Did you two prepare this beforehand!?,Otto
About here.,Lewes
"Otto, stop. There's something weird about Lewes-san.",Subaru
Are we returning to the village?,Otto
The barrier... then it's the same as when Emilia entered SANCTUARY.,Subaru
What is 'dull skinned'. There isn't any such thing as skin being sensitive or dull.,Otto
Was part of you coming along perhaps to test that?,Subaru
And Emilia'd feel the same thing if she came this far.,Subaru
"...Kinda feel there's some information in there I can't let slide, again.",Subaru
Then he's bringing them here and trapping them? What the hell's he thinking?,Subaru
"Good dragon. Yer go help yer master good, now.",Lewes
And there's another serious overestimation... it's just intuition though.,Subaru
It's the intuition of a woman who's lived over 100 years.,Lewes
"Well, see you again, Lewes-san. Take care and get back safely.",Subaru
"...Kinda, felt uneasy there.",Subaru
Which's because I had a terrible experience the first time...,Subaru
Please let nothing have happened...,Subaru
"Ultimately, have to go ahead on the second-best track...",Subaru
—Huu.,Subaru
"I'm just the age for aspiring towards being one of those naughty wild badboys... er,",Subaru
"Good,",Petra
"What is the matter, Subaru-sama?",Petra
"Ahh, augghh! Seriously, just too cute, you!",Subaru
Wa-waah!?,Petra
"What, what is ti!? Ah, wait, Subaru... it's still so early...",Petra
"Seriously, god damn it.",Subaru
—Subaru?,Petra
Does somewhere hurt?,Petra
"Nope,",Subaru
"I'm just truly, from the bottom of my heart, relieved. —I'm home, Petra.",Subaru
Really?!,Petra
You go visit them afterwards. You show them your maid outfit and they'll be overjoyed.,Subaru
"Mmhm. After I get permission from Big Sis Frederica, I'll get changed and go back!",Petra
"No, don't get changed... you're so cute, so if you show everyone...",Subaru
"Ehehee, I'm cute? I'm cute?",Petra
"You're cute, you're cute. So make sure everyone...",Subaru
Right! I'll get changed and go back!,Petra
"Sorry, Petra. Let us be alone for a while.",Subaru
"When it's to talk, wondering what I should prioritise... this is where I wind up.",Subaru
...Rem.,Subaru
"So pathetic... I'm seriously, so weak.",Subaru
"You might not feel this way, but it's thanks to you that my resolve hardens.",Subaru
"You, and Petra, and everyone else... I'll get you all out of here safely.",Subaru
Yes?,Subaru
Makes things quick. ...Do you have an idea what I want to talk about?,Subaru
Most probably.,Frederica
That the Master neglected to return would suggest the TRIAL is yet to be finished.,Frederica
"Yeah,",Subaru
Contracts again... goddamn everybody.,Subaru
Is it okay if I ask you about the details of that contract?,Subaru
"Would you be aware of the Demihuman War, Subaru-sama?",Frederica
There is no need to be so wary. They are merely confectioneries for the tea.,Frederica
"The Demihuman War—Firstly, would you know of the general content of this dispute?",Frederica
"My, intriguing. May I ask in what manner you conceive it?",Frederica
"Right,",Subaru
...Please do proceed.,Frederica
"My, my. You are certainly adept at bestowing others motivation.",Frederica
The incident that followed?,Subaru
"Slaughtered? By who, and for what purpose?",Subaru
"No, just surprised at hearing a name I know. Small world.",Subaru
"Surname, yours was Frederica... Baumann?",Subaru
Although it is rather embarrassing to say...,Frederica
What!? Hold on wait! I can't hear this without preparing my heart first!,Subaru
"Waitwaitwait, I'm sorry! I didn't think it was gonna get this heavy!",Subaru
Stubbornness...,Subaru
"Uhhh,",Subaru
...What are you trying to say?,Subaru
"—Wha, why.",Subaru
Quarter-bloods... and that's why you the barrier didn't catch you.,Subaru
"If he can come outside, then...",Subaru
"Stubborn... no way,",Subaru
Grandmother... you mean Lewes-san?,Subaru
"Within answerable range, yeah?",Subaru
I do apologize for that.,Frederica
Is asking about Roswaal's real intentions an okay topic?,Subaru
Can't say anything more about it without said Roswaal's permission.,Subaru
A test site—you say.,Frederica
...Why would you believe such?,Frederica
"I desired that, when the new world one day opened... I would be to guide them into it.",Frederica
"Undesired, that's...",Subaru
"...Does Garfiel know about your true feelings? If he knows, but still didn't come out...",Subaru
"So,",Subaru
"Ueg... Um, that's... I wasn't thinking. Sorry.",Subaru
So long as her studies're vaguely going forward. Where's she now?,Subaru
"Gonna take time, but for now let's try going one-by-one through the mansion...",Subaru
'Sweird. This should've been the last door in the mansion...,Subaru
It's like she's seriously goddamn avoiding me.,Subaru
Are Puck and Beatrice seriously not gonna talk at all at vital moments?,Subaru
"Right, there was something I wanted to check here.",Subaru
Hidden passage'll be behind these bookshelves.,Subaru
"And so to check, zip into the escape route... is what I was thinking, but...",Subaru
"Have to call it quits, huh... Might not even be inside this room...",Subaru
"Ohh,",Subaru
In the corner of the room was a sculpture... is this where the trick is?,Subaru
"Tyah,",Petra
"Oh, oh, ohhh...",Subaru
"Hereherehere it is. I'd been looking for it, thanks.",Subaru
"Yup, thankyouthankyou. Now let's just dash... Petra, since when've you!?",Subaru
You're asking now!?,Petra
"By the way Petra, did Frederica tell you where this leads?",Subaru
Got it. Indeed it is a hidden passage. But I'm gonna check it with my own eyes too.,Subaru
"You're coming too, Petra?",Subaru
I can't?,Petra
"Now would be my break hours, so I am also free. So it is okay if I come too, right?",Petra
"It really is just going and coming back. You're a curious one, Petra.",Subaru
If I wasn't curious I wouldn't be here... I'm glad I'm a curious one.,Petra
"The staircase's a little long and dark, so be careful not to slip.",Subaru
If I slip will you save me?,Petra
"If that happens, I will care for you your whole life, Subaru-sama.",Petra
I'm glad but getting there's terrifying!,Subaru
"Going down while saying nothing's boring, and you might be scared Petra so let's talk.",Subaru
"Subaru-sama, do you realise that your palm is slightly sweaty?",Petra
And you might be scared Petra so let's talk! How was everyone at the village?,Subaru
"Escape route, escape path, tunnel, we can't decide what to call it.",Petra
"Yeah. In a wind blows from Mexico meaning, let's call it Santana.",Subaru
"Ah, don't trip, there's a bump there.",Petra
The air's cold... maybe on the other side of the door.,Petra
"Yeah,",Subaru
—ah?,Subaru
Aah—!?,Petra
—SHAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC!,Subaru
"Wall of confusion, if you're something scalable I'll scale y—gggaaaaaaaugh!!",Subaru
Subaru!,Petra
"Anyway, upstairs!",Subaru
Guigh... augahh!?,Subaru
She saw!?,Subaru
This's... bad!,Subaru
"aeeheuiiiI, Iii!",Subaru
Fuhreder...,Subaru
Don't speak! That wound... it's terrible.,Frederica
"a,...",Frederica
aauAhh—!,Subaru
—Shh!!,Frederica
Appears we have an intruder.,Frederica
To the mansion. Signal when at the top. I will follow.,Frederica
Bhu...,Subaru
With those wounds you'll be a burden regardless. —Take care of Petra.,Frederica
Dhon't die.,Subaru
Of course not. —I haven't finished yet.,Frederica
Ih'm... mahde it!,Subaru
"Fuhre, dherhaa! Ihsssaohkae!",Subaru

"'Sisnt, timeto be doing this... I'm, idiot...",Subaru

"...What're, yhou doinhg.",Subaru
"Healhing... the wouhnds? What, for?",Subaru
"Ah,",Beatrice
"Because... you're unseemly and, I can't bear to look...",Beatrice
Then! There shoulhdn't be any fuckihng reasohn for you to help me!,Subaru
"What... are you saying, I suppose...",Beatrice

Uu?,Subaru
"Head, hurts...",Subaru
"Hurts to have to feign ignorance with Emilia again, but...",Subaru
Wha—!? Aa!?,Subaru

"—a,",Beatrice
B-Betty was only... only...,Beatrice

Ah...,Subaru
"No, I... S-sorry. I didn't mean to say... It isn't your fault at...",Subaru
"I'm sorry. Thank you, for healing my wounds. But, now I...",Subaru
The GOSPEL's in the carriage... it being in the archive shouldn't...,Subaru
—No!,Beatrice
Why're you treating that thing like it's so important?,Subaru
"Hey—please, deny it.",Subaru
"...Betty is not instructed to answer your question, I suppose.",Beatrice
You don't do anything if it's not what the book says?,Subaru
"That question is not written in the book, in fact.",Beatrice
"Those questions are not written in the book, I suppose.",Beatrice
"What about right now, how you're talking with me? And, saving me when I tried to die?",Subaru
—Not my business.,Beatrice
So you can't do goddamn anything if it's not what the book says!?,Subaru
"I told you... that's exactly what I am saying, I suppose!!",Beatrice
Bea...,Subaru
Sto—Beatrice!,Subaru
Couldn't care less. Hate you. I hate you. —I hate you!,Beatrice

"Why... for Betty, is nothing...",Beatrice
—Aguuah!?,Subaru
Beatrice...,Subaru
Why... can I never...,Subaru
"How come, you and a gospel... Just, what is with you!?",Subaru
...Is that really true?,Subaru
Back then... I was happy.,Subaru
...Where am I?,Subaru
Ueh!?,Subaru
"—What else,",Subaru
"A magic circle... is what it looks like, but...",Subaru
"Then I get why there's empty magequartz tumbled all around it, too.",Subaru
"In the end, still no answer to where I am.",Subaru
The time and way this one was broken's seriously different from the desk by the hole...,Subaru
A destroyed room... who and for what purpose...,Subaru
—,Subaru
"Directionally speaking from where I came, on the other side of this door'll be... yeah.",Subaru
"If this is... inside the mansion, then...",Subaru
Where—is... this?,Subaru
M-morning?,Subaru
"Then, while I was unconscious!?",Subaru
If the save point gets overwritten like this...!,Subaru
"—Fucking, fuck!",Subaru
S-SANCTUARY!?,Subaru
"Why... here? Because, GATE CROSSING?",Subaru
"Anyway! If I'm in SANCTUARY, then... Roswaal!!",Subaru
Roswaal! Show yourself! Gotta whole lotta questions for you!,Subaru
No playing innocent and no lies. You'll spill everything you're hiding...,Subaru
...huh?,Subaru
It's not just Roswaal and Ram... where did everyone go?,Subaru
Can't be...,Subaru
Someone! Anyone here!? Where'd you go!?,Subaru
—Aaaah!,Subaru

"Gheuh, agghhk!",Subaru
"uaahhhh, ahhh!?",Subaru
"What, at... the end...",Subaru
Fingers!?,Subaru
Ah...,Subaru
"Fingers... are there, so...",Subaru
"Any... anyway so, now...",Subaru
Emili... a...,Subaru
The restart point hasn't changed!,Subaru
"But, usual method hasn't been working this time.",Subaru
The end of last time... Why was SANCTUARY empty?,Subaru
...No way.,Subaru
"I,",Subaru
Anyway...,Subaru
"Things're this stuck, 'cause there's a guy around who's gotta start talking.",Subaru
I'll change what I did completely.,Subaru
"—How much do you know, Roswaal?",Subaru
Hmmmmmmmm.,Roswaal
Just got back from taking the TRIAL. —Gotta load of questions.,Subaru
"...Really, now. You and the TRIAL. I see. I see, Iiiiiiiiiii do seeeeeee.",Roswaal
"Noooooow then, let's have me ask a question.",Roswaal
"If I answer that question... no, actually wait.",Subaru
I'm not answering your questions. I'm the one who wants to talk. I talk first.,Subaru
"...My, weeeeeeell isn't that raaaaaaaaaather arrogant.",Roswaal
Goooooo ahead.,Roswaal
"—You raising that question here, perhaps means you've remembered?",Roswaal
Shut up.,Subaru
Wha—!?,Subaru
"Nooooooow,",Roswaal
This time it's your turn to answer myyyyyyyy question. —Have you remembered?,Roswaal
That reply told me your answer to my question. ...Unfortunate.,Roswaal
It seems I won't be reaching it.,Roswaal
...What're?,Subaru
"Your turn to question. Ask a beeeeeetter, uuuuuuundodgable query this time.",Roswaal
"Noooooow,",Roswaal
"Hiring a lord. ...Then, this's something different from a contract?",Subaru
There!,Subaru
"That contract from 400 years ago, its details are what I wanna know.",Subaru
"Fuck, useless! If I just knew about this 400-years contract...",Subaru
"However, I can tell you this.",Roswaal
Make... the contract break?,Subaru
—Did I say a single word about wanting to take Beatrice outside?,Subaru
You truly are—a man who ooooooonly notices what I'd rather you not.,Roswaal
What do you...,Subaru
Don't—don't you fucking piss around!,Subaru
You haaaaaaave no questions?,Roswaal
"Ohhhhh, so you saw it. Your impressions? Just what did you thiiiiiiink of it?",Roswaal
"Don't answer with a question. —The books the witch cultists have, resemble it, I, think.",Subaru
—! You know them?,Subaru
Th-they seriously tell the future... do they?,Subaru
Imperfect...,Subaru
"This and that are different stories. Um, that book Beatrice had...",Subaru
Don't dodge! This is important!,Subaru
Perfect....?,Subaru
—!?,Subaru
That's... a GOSPEL telling the future?,Subaru
Preeeeeeeecisely. This is a legitimate GOSPEL.,Roswaal
"You... know the future? That things would be like this, now, in that book...?",Subaru
Is iiiiiiiindeed written. You wouldn't be able to read it though.,Roswaal
"It writes... what will happen, next?",Subaru
"That, things would be how they are now... was something you knew?",Subaru
"If you knew that things would be like this, then...",Subaru
—Mhm.,Roswaal
—You knowingly left Rem to die?,Subaru
Nooooooow just whooooooo is Rem?,Roswaal
—I'll kill you! ROSWAAAAAAAAAAALL!!,Subaru
"You knew everything, and you—!!",Subaru
The reason I left Rem to die—was you!!,Subaru
"I don't, know... Rem.",Subaru
Wh-what ha...!?,Subaru
"My head, hurts...",Subaru
"If I died, I'd be post- RETURN BY DEATH now, but...",Subaru
I didn't die...,Subaru
Garfiel.,Subaru
"Who'da thought,",Garfiel
"Directly, meaning what exactly?",Subaru
Met in the tomb?,Subaru
The witch!,Subaru
"Then, could this be what Roswaal was saying I forgot...?",Subaru
Yer shuttin' up means yer feelin' guilty or that ya got an idea.,Garfiel
There's Garfiel.,Subaru
Healing... from who?,Subaru
Think there's anyone'n this place 'cept my amazin' self who couldda done it?,Garfiel
"My head's still got its normal shape and isn't a cube or a pyramid, right?",Subaru
"Next time it's busted, I'll make a shape where you'll be proppin' it up with yer hands.",Garfiel
"Well, what do yer think's my aim?",Garfiel
"You can't leave, when your blood relative Frederica could, Garf?",Subaru
You can't sever the blood in your body with a figure of spee...,Subaru
"No way... you, too?",Subaru
Me too... say.,Garfiel
"Why're you thinkin' that, huh?",Garfiel
You sound like yer gonna cry.,Garfiel
Then! So you know too!,Subaru
"—Ah, so that's what this's about. Wonder where you noticed.",Garfiel
—!?,Subaru
"What you, wanted to know...",Subaru
Hey!,Subaru
"Wait! ...Wh-what'll happen with me. Or actually, what is happening with me?",Subaru
Ain't the results obvious?,Garfiel
"But, back at that moment...",Subaru
"I just, don't know anymore...",Subaru
"I don't have... a single, answer.",Subaru
I'm hungry...,Subaru
It's probably too late...,Subaru
"—I sure, fucked this up.",Subaru
...I'm shit. Just fucking die.,Subaru
"If I don't, then for what purpose...",Subaru
"I return without knowing anything, and I'm just back where I started again.",Subaru
"Yeah, I...",Subaru
—nnnm,Subaru
Who... is this?,Subaru
Auh?,Subaru
"Refined so I don't get any shock, with frank content so I accept reality.",Subaru
"Ah, I didn't ask for it in chuuni but yes that is enough.",Subaru
I was healed... is what was supposed to have happened.,Subaru
"No helping it,",Subaru
"Call that honest, or something. He's another guy I just don't get.",Subaru
"...Complaining's not gonna move things forward, but no one's gonna help me. Fuck.",Subaru
"He's incredible, this man! That you're capable of saying this, even I find refreshing!",Otto
"Who is this, this old appa salesman!",Otto
A starting spot for me. Could also call him Mr. Save Point.,Subaru
"Anyway, putting aside jokes etcetera there... I've got lots of things I wanna ask.",Subaru
A divide? What do you mean?,Subaru
"But,",Subaru
"Why'd this suddenly happen again? From what I've seen... I mean, anticipated.",Subaru
"Well, now see,",Otto
One of the causes?,Subaru
Wanna pile up arguments getting an answer to that one.,Subaru
A part in escaping?,Subaru
"No way,",Subaru
I would like it if my name could be added to that list of persons you wouldn't want injured.,Otto
"That's the first time I'm hearing that, but probably, that's not how you're meant to use it.",Otto
Don't think that's super reckless? And this collaborator...,Subaru
"You're saying my body makes good bait, well I can't deny that.",Subaru
"That doesn't explain why I couldn't find the residents of SANCTUARY, who can't leave...",Subaru
"Leaving that as that,",Otto
"I'm honestly impressed, and you really helped me. How'd you find me?",Subaru
"Hmhmhm! You want to know? You'd like to know, he wants to know.",Otto
Yes but could you please give me back my feelings of superiority!?,Otto
"Really is handy, your blessing.",Subaru
...It truly isn't that great of a thing.,Otto
"Anyway,",Otto
Prep time 'till enacting the plan's way too short.,Subaru
"Oh, can I ask one last thing?",Subaru
"Sorry, sorry. ...Why did you take such a risk to help me?",Subaru
"Please answer, Otto. Why are you risking yourself like this?",Subaru
"I wonder just what kind of person you think I am, Natsuki-san.",Otto
"I swear,",Otto
"You know, Natsuki-san,",Otto
...Yeah?,Subaru
—Is it truly so strange to help a friend?,Otto
"Wh-why is his face frozen in surprise, this man.",Otto
Pals!? Who and who are!?,Subaru
Me! And you are!,Otto
Are you listening?,Otto
—,Subaru
—Pfff,Subaru
Pardon?,Otto
"Hahahahaahaha! F-friends? Friends! Ahh, right right. Otto, you wanted to be my friend!?",Subaru
Wha!?,Otto
"Pffhahaah, friends. Ahh, shit. Otto, you bastard, you.",Subaru
"Sorry. You are my friend, Otto. —Thank you, for saving me.",Subaru
"Thinking like that, if we didn't have your blessing yeah this'd be hopeless.",Subaru
Nature's scary!,Subaru
"I need more information, including about the unconfirmed GOSPEL.",Subaru
I see it. We'll be exiting near the village soon.,Otto
"Well, the collaborator—",Otto
"'Safe' while looking at this eye's sure something, huh!",Subaru
"Sorry, I don't usually pay you very proper attention and can't tell the difference.",Ram
By syllogism!?,Subaru
"Yes many, but firstly why have you gotten so wary, Natsuki-san?",Otto
What is there to trust about a man who is watched daily with bloodlust!?,Otto
"Honestly, I thought the moment you saw my face you'd try to kill me no questions asked.",Subaru
"Otto said we're meant to rendezvous with someone here, but...",Subaru
"Yes, I am aware.",Ram
"Natsuki-san. I know it's difficult to believe, but what you see is the truth.",Otto
Hrmmm,Subaru
"Tell me,",Subaru
"You certainly ask piling questions. Verbosity does not make men popular, Barusu.",Ram
—,Subaru
Wh—Natsuki-san!?,Otto
"Ass ass ass shut up, are dirty jokes the only humour you have, wordbound.",Subaru
I don't know what that means but it feels like incredible defamation! Does feel it!,Otto
"...Do relax. This action, at the least, is unconcerned with Roswaal-sama's noble will.",Ram
"Unconcerned... with Roswaal? No wait, but that means...",Subaru
"With how detailed the text'd be, the thing'd be enormous...",Subaru
"That's more than head over heels get a room, fuck.",Subaru
However...,Ram
Now that it's like this?,Subaru
"Nowaitwait,",Subaru
"Well, time to do the plan. How much leeway time do you think we have?",Subaru
"So one hour. We have that, and we can get out of SANCTUARY's barrier at least.",Subaru
"Ram,",Subaru
"Garf, yes?",Ram
...you knew?,Subaru
What do we do?,Subaru
The reason he'll aim for me... um...,Subaru
—Barusu?,Ram
"Uh, uh-huh.",Subaru
"You just can't talk to me without putting that bullying in, huh? Right, Otto?",Subaru
"Er, I incredibly feel that I can't agree with you asking me for validation.",Otto
"—A moon pale, a moon crazed. That night, too, was moonlit like this.",Ram
"It was fifteen minutes, but it could've been even shorter. Five minutes-ish...",Subaru
"Doesn't feel bad to be worried about, though.",Subaru
"...Ah, so that's what it is.",Subaru
The people saved by Rem's actions are aiming their gratitude for her at me.,Subaru
...Makes me wanna puke. At the absurdity and sleaze.,Subaru
"Mn, ah, don't worry. I'm okay. ...You're another good girl who's wasted on me.",Subaru
"What. The evacuation’s going good, I think.",Subaru
"Yes, currently it's going so good it's nearly too good. But a problem's arisen.",Otto
"Natsuki-san, please listen carefully.",Otto
Hm?,Subaru
"—The forest is chattering, astir. Something OUTRAGEOUS is coming.",Otto
"Is that something OUTRAGEOUS, coming right now?",Subaru
"Your being here's unnatural that so this's inevitable but, would you like to explain this?",Subaru
Ram hasn't told me anything about there being someone like that in SANCTUARY...,Subaru
...That all'a the evacuees?,Garfiel
Hmm?,Garfiel
"Oi, y'know you, 's looks yer misunderstandin'.",Garfiel
Misunderstanding?,Subaru
Then what the heck are you doing here...,Subaru
...You've really been thinking more than I imagined.,Subaru
"Now anyway,",Garfiel
Hell's that. —Don't like it a bit.,Garfiel
"You won't mind if we keep ignoring you and return everyone to the village, yeah?",Subaru
'S just gettin' ridda the poor form of gettin' escaped on. Do what yer want.,Garfiel
"Well then, we'll be obliging...",Subaru
"—However,",Garfiel
...Your motive?,Subaru
Again with this thing...,Subaru
Condition is I stay behind in SANCTUARY. No objections there?,Subaru
Natsuki-san...,Otto
I don't like this.,Ram
"Y'know,",Subaru
"Have you not realised, Barusu? What it is you are saying.",Ram
What?,Subaru
"If you don't understand, fine.",Ram
It's something pointless to you now. A waste of time.,Ram
You...,Subaru
Now now now!,Otto
"Tch. Anyway, explain it.",Subaru
Tch. There is no longer anything I wish to say.,Ram
Could you two please not click your tongues at me while you speak!?,Otto
Our talks're all done. We're going on your condition. Let everyone through.,Subaru
"Everyone 'cept you, 's. Get them goin' now. 'S that dragon stayin'?",Garfiel
"If there can be smiling at the end, it's my... it's our win.",Subaru
—,Subaru
"There's a mountain of things I wanna confirm, though...",Subaru
Garfiel?,Subaru
Garfiel! What're...,Subaru
"Yer really fuckin' gonna get n' the way? The fuck's yer motive, huh?",Garfiel
Ram!?,Subaru
"'F the wind hadn't screwed th' aim, his head woulda been popped off.",Garfiel
"What're you, doing, Garfiel! You wanted to kill me!?",Subaru
That's...,Subaru
I...,Garfiel
"Listening is worthless, and attempting persuasion is pointless, Barusu.",Ram
"Cease hiding your feelings with tenable logic, Garf. It isn't like you.",Ram
"H-hey, Ram,",Subaru
"Step down, I will speak. —As regardless, it appears Garf would like to kill you.",Ram
"Wh-wait. You two, what're you...",Subaru
"Listen! No, tell me! What do you know you two doing this!",Subaru
Ram!,Subaru
Y'said things not fuckin' needed. Gonna be a damn pain chasin' 'em now.,Garfiel
You think I will let you leave?,Ram
Truly?,Ram
Eh?,Garfiel
"Truly, do you... not understand why I am doing this, Garf?",Ram
You...,Garfiel
I don't goddamn believe it. You doin' this kinda fuckin' thing is...,Garfiel
"—For Frederica, and for you.",Ram
Don't your mouth say the name of that traitor!!,Garfiel
Garf...,Ram
"Just go back. Won't say it again. Go back, and wait 'till the TRIAL's cleaned up.",Garfiel
But still! It's so much better than havin' nothing left!,Garfiel
"Garf, haven't I always been telling you? —That is merely compensatory behaviour.",Ram
"Then, Garf. —Would you abandon all except me?",Ram
I-I...,Garfiel
I am.,Ram
—I am.,Ram
"Known it fer ages, but yer a stubborn one.",Garfiel
Really.,Garfiel
"Farewell, Garf.",Ram
"Goodbye, Ram.",Garfiel
Patrasche! Stop! I told you stop!!,Subaru
Was you listening to everything I've said until now just favours!?,Subaru
Ram's in trouble! I don't wanna think Garfiel'd do anything violent to her... but now's!,Subaru
"I... hate getting hurt, but I'll recover. So...!",Subaru
—Huh?,Subaru
"Wh-what's the matter, Natsuki-san? So quickly...",Otto
But you're not meant to pass though? What happened to Garfiel?,Otto
I-I don't really get it either... Ram and Patrasche...,Subaru
Wha—!?,Subaru
Huiih!?,Otto
"Ah, Natsuki-san!?",Otto
"Aguh, Patrasche!",Subaru
"—au,",Subaru
"Wh, at...",Subaru
"Wai—! Hey, Patrasche!?",Subaru
"—a,",Subaru
Is that thing... why SANCTUARY was empty?,Subaru
—Huh?,Subaru
"Ancestral, return...",Subaru
"If he's a war tiger, then...",Subaru
"Garfiel, you... what did you do to Ram?",Subaru

Answer! What did you do to Ram! Garfiel!!,Subaru
GARFIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEL!!,Subaru
"You, despised me that much?",Subaru

Why wasn't I killed?,Subaru
"Even saying hypothetically, he carried them away...",Subaru
But on the other hand...,Subaru
"S-SANCTUARY's also, in the same condition as last time... maybe?",Subaru
...I'm sorry.,Subaru
"Half a day... fin, ally...",Subaru
"You fucking come back, Garfiel?",Subaru
"Not here, huh...",Subaru
Should I try going to Roswaal's place?,Subaru
So... to...,Subaru

Since she's a Mighty Witch gone four-fucking-hundred years static.,Subaru
So... what's the occasion for the tea party invite?,Subaru
Stop being convoluted.,Subaru
What happened to me?,Subaru
Echidna! Let me out of here right now!,Subaru
"...au,",Subaru
You...,Subaru
Echidna... How much do you know?,Subaru
"Ignoring that, that means this reunion's happening immediately after we parted...",Subaru
How!?,Subaru
"That couldn't... isn't a GOSPEL, right?",Subaru
...you're dead though.,Subaru
Truth?,Subaru
"Then don't shove it in people's faces, that's horrifying!",Subaru
Haaa... haa...,Subaru
—!?,Subaru
You might not get time to regret it.,Subaru
Echidna. I've RETURNED BY DEATH—,Subaru
—before.,Subaru
...huh?,Subaru
...hrm.,Subaru
"...That's not why I'm ogling. No, I mean nevermind that.",Subaru
"I... When I die, I go back in time, and re-do the world. I've RETURNED BY DEATH.",Subaru
Why won't the hand come?,Subaru
You should at least know that's not what I...!,Subaru
Can you assure that?,Subaru
"Right... right, ri... right...",Subaru
—?,Subaru
wh...,Subaru
"...underst—anding is hard with you, you know.",Subaru
"Understood, fuck!",Subaru
"There, drank it all. Now're you interested in accepting me as a member of the tea party?",Subaru
EeuGHhh I forgot—!,Subaru
"The agent for my RETURN BY DEATH... would be the Witch of ENVY, right?",Subaru
There's no dying here?,Subaru
Do sorta feel if the dream's really horrific you could die of shock...,Subaru
"...? But you're dead and a ghost, wouldn't you remember your death?",Subaru
...That's not just coming from being killed. With that anger.,Subaru
Except its origins...,Subaru
—Do you think my power RETURN BY DEATH has limited uses?,Subaru
"...Sure, please tell me.",Subaru
"—I, see.",Subaru
"Sorry for the bad reaction, and not answering your expectations... but...",Subaru
Gut.,Subaru
"Fixed, conditions?",Subaru
Root of delusions... meaning?,Subaru
Feels like going for love running out'd be so much easier...,Subaru
—Huh?,Subaru
That's also my gut.,Subaru
"Ignoring that, you're probably not lying—is how I'm thinking.",Subaru
"But still, there really was some heartflutter there...",Subaru
Can I ask another question about RETURN BY DEATH?,Subaru
"Uh, uh-huh... right. Well, so the first save point...",Subaru
Change our thinking?,Subaru
Reaching a reason we can overcome?,Subaru
"Every time the situation I can't change changes, RETURN BY DEATH shifts?",Subaru
"The being causing it, is...",Subaru
au...,Subaru
—The chance to take back those sacrifices won't be coming.,Subaru
"Right then... if your favouritism's only for me, my mind's made up.",Subaru
"This's all I'm gonna get on RETURN BY DEATH. Either way, that did help, thanks.",Subaru
"Then, this time I'll be relying right on that knowledge of yours.",Subaru
I just RETURNED BY DEATH... do you know how I died this time?,Subaru
"Yeah,",Subaru
"Just remembering it gives me shakes, but... this time, I was eaten.",Subaru
Sizeable hares?,Subaru
The Sizeable Hare is...,Subaru
"There was this anxiety with the White Whale, too, but... which one's worse?",Subaru
Hard to destroy...,Subaru
"No, I've at least figured out they don't match up with their loveable appearance...",Subaru
Do you know if it's possible to defeat them?,Subaru
Cannibalism... wh-just why the fuck were these monsters made!?,Subaru
"The Sizeable Hare's still defeatable, if you kill all of them.",Subaru
"Heard about these two before, but they really are monsters...",Subaru
Hold on.,Subaru
Echidna.,Subaru
"Echidna, I want to meet the Witch of GLUTTONY—to meet Daphne.",Subaru
Don't know until you try. It's trial and error—words you're apparently fond of.,Subaru
"And also,",Subaru
"Yess, thanks.",Subaru
"Hold up... this, is...",Subaru
"Poor affinity with me, but does anyone with good affinity here even exist!?",Subaru
"Held stuck in restraints, and both eyes covered... agewise is a surprise, too...",Subaru
—!?,Subaru
—You were sleeping!?!,Subaru
"Y-yeah, my bad. I got kinda heated up. I didn't mean to yell.",Subaru
Ghuh... I apologize. So please feel better. No getting mad.,Subaru
"Hey,",Subaru
"That is a pretty damn tricky request when I'm feeding you, that!",Subaru
Those assurances just made you less credible! The reason! Please tell me the reason!,Subaru
My BO's poison now!?,Subaru
"...Huh? I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood what you said?",Subaru
"E-eat me... like, eat out raw?",Subaru
"I-I'll be throwing aiming at you, but sorry if I miss your mouth, okay?",Subaru
"That sounds amazingly disconcerting, but... okay, here goes!",Subaru
You're throwing off my aim so could you please be quiet?!,Subaru
"—Ah,",Subaru
—!?,Subaru
"...No, being unfazed here's impossible.",Subaru
"What... is that, am I okay to ask?",Subaru
"Made... that's, a living creature... is it?",Subaru
Why!?!,Subaru
"—au, uh, wha?",Subaru
"What, are you...",Subaru
Multi... hwa?,Subaru
"What you're saying's partly correct... but, that kind of thinking's...",Subaru

"What, on earth just... or, you, how come,",Subaru

——Donald!?,Subaru
Th-thank you for healing me!,Subaru
...Stop fucking around.,Subaru
That's how the Sizeable Hare sees the world...?,Subaru
...I was an idiot for asking.,Subaru
"—wha, it got through?",Subaru
"Seriously that level? ...No, I know you're not reliable. I'll check it with my own eyes.",Subaru
"Sorry for the big ask, Echidna.",Subaru
I'll be declining your bodily fluids and mystery something-in-there cookies.,Subaru
I can't just trust what you say!,Subaru
"Not fond of that look, where it's like you're seeing through to my insides.",Subaru
Of what?,Subaru
Awry?,Subaru
"Sure not getting to the point. I mean, where're you going with...",Subaru
I've already decided to use the crap out of what I can.,Subaru
It's 'cause I've died too much. ...I've probably started going some kind of crazy.,Subaru
Don't degrade yourself like that—esque kind of consolation's what I was expecting?,Subaru
"No choice then,",Subaru
Nm—,Subaru
"The end of this tea party, then... say it's useful and I'd say it was useful.",Subaru
What should I do when I want to come here?,Subaru
There's nothing persuasive when you're being so weirdly happy and meandering with it!,Subaru
...Echinda.,Subaru
"Yeah, I'd really rather not...",Subaru
"See you again at the TRIAL, then. Guess there won't be any tea there.",Subaru
I forgot my stuff?,Subaru
Compensation...,Subaru
"...oe, eu?",Subaru
The handkerchief Petra gave me before coming to SANCTUARY...?,Subaru
...Petra did.,Subaru
"Just, thanks for your time. And everything. —Bid you farewell.",Subaru
"Uuhgge! Gehhphph! Is this, the default every time...!?",Subaru
Echidna kept her promise. The tea party's not gone from my memory this time.,Subaru
"And the most important crop from this time... 's saying that really okay, but it was there.",Subaru
"My sense of time's off thanks to the tea party, but this's just after the TRIAL, right.",Subaru
...Where's Emilia?,Subaru
"If I'm right after the TRIAL, Emilia should still be doing hers...",Subaru
...,Subaru
...No way.,Subaru
A... shadow.,Subaru
—,Subaru
E-Emilia—!,Subaru
"Ram! Lewes-san! Also Otto! You're here, right!? Please come out!",Subaru
"Anyway, what I have to confirm now is...",Subaru
"But still, just leaving me there and exiting doesn't sound anything like Emilia.",Subaru
—ue?,Subaru
—?,Subaru
Wha—,Subaru
——a?,Subaru
"Wh, y...!?",Subaru
Uaoeuu—!?,Subaru
"Why, did you... me, Garfiel...",Subaru
"Eh? Don't fuckin' joke 'round, you fuckin' seen what things are?",Garfiel
"'M grabbin' yer collar'n jumpin'. Might break yer neck but, grin'n bear it.",Garfiel
I don't have some mystery constitution where grinning makes my neck any stronge—!?,Subaru
"Arrh, fuckin' bullshit! EARTHSOUL BLESSING ain't workin' when the ground's like this—!",Garfiel
"Say Garfiel, my ground's sinking in too!",Subaru
"—Hr, don't yer bite yer tounge!!",Garfiel
"Hup, hah, hhraah—!",Garfiel
Th-thank you for saving me...!,Subaru
"Nnwhat? That ain't the face of a guy givin' a thanks, oi, yer got a problem?",Garfiel
No thank you.,Subaru
"S's real bad,",Garfiel
"'S goes without sayin', but don't look 's n' any mood ter let us go.",Garfiel
Garfiel. Do you know what that thing is?,Subaru
What'd y'jus' say?,Garfiel
"—Garfiel. They... Ram and the others, what happened to them?",Subaru
...In the shadow.,Garfiel
"...And, Ram was swallowed? And Lewes-san, Otto?",Subaru
"Yeh, th'were. Granny n' th' noisy guy, all'n one go.",Garfiel
"Wh-just what is this, seriously, it... why is this, suddenly...!",Subaru
Garfiel... what happened to Emilia?,Subaru
"Emilia wasn't in the tomb. ...Was she, swallowed, too?",Subaru
"By the shadow... then, that...!",Subaru
Why the fuck is the Witch of ENVY here!!,Subaru
Ain't th' time t'be askin' that.,Garfiel
"Uau, aaoauu!",Subaru
"'M jumpin' again, grab on!",Garfiel

Yer gonna get left behind 'f yer don't get down quick!,Garfiel
Uoawuagh—,Subaru
Y-you didn't need to kick me down!,Subaru
"Garfiel, what do we do!",Subaru
—!,Subaru
We can back off but things'll still be getting worse... what happened to your attacks?,Subaru
...Shit.,Garfiel
Body's heavy. —Shadow's fuckin' stealin' life from what's around.,Garfiel
The shadow under us is!?,Subaru
No way—,Subaru
The forest's sinking!?,Subaru
"'S what'll happen 'f yer ain't keepin' moving. 'Said, 's gettin' stronger more it eats, too!",Garfiel
"There's no way this could actually escalate into covering half the world tier, right...?",Subaru
"Garfiel, I'm who it's aiming for. So...",Subaru
—. Y-you're positive on that?,Subaru
Which means without you there's even less ways to oppose it...,Subaru
"And granny! And Ram! And everyone else, all of them eaten!",Garfiel
—!,Subaru
"Then why's it that with everyone, you...",Subaru
—Wha!?,Subaru
Why is Lewes-san...?,Subaru
"Garfiel, what is the...",Subaru
—σσσσσȠ!,Garfiel
—!?,Subaru
"What kind of, joke is...",Subaru
Didn't want t' show yer if I could help it.,Garfiel
"The scratches from the branches hurt, and my heart too... It's reality.",Subaru
—,Subaru
"Sorry f'r this while yer in th' middle of ponderin', but looks like now's 'bout time.",Garfiel
"Surround n' conquer. 'S simple, but with everythin' else eaten that's all's left.",Garfiel

Shut up.,Subaru
I told you to shut up...,Subaru
...,Subaru
"—Don't, call me that!!",Subaru
...not moving?,Subaru
"Why're you so suddenly... no way, my words did that?",Subaru
If just being rejected by me's enough to throw your actions off this much...,Subaru
"Can't tell how she'd act, but... then'd my presence be the Witch of ENVY's weak point...?",Subaru
—,Subaru
—It couldnt've been Echidna's tea party?,Subaru
You... just goddamn egotistic...,Subaru
"The heck... you sure get lively the second I say the name of another girl, hell!",Subaru
"Don't just line up the I love yous, makes them kitsch.",Subaru
If I had to love a witch like you...,Subaru
"They're witches too, but Echidna and the others are more loveable—",Subaru
"—ou,",Subaru
Distance isn't the problem. It's not resounding in my heart's what—,Subaru
—I hate you.,Subaru
"I am never, going to love you.",Subaru
—!,Subaru
"—ue, ou?",Subaru
Then...!,Subaru
Why is... nevermind!,Subaru
Woah! With this... I can do it!,Subaru
That Echidna... did she goddamn know that this'd happen?,Subaru
"If she's readied me with a way to fight the witch, I'll go thank her.",Subaru
Negligence is The Enemy!,Subaru
—Rrruaaaaah!,Subaru
Got her—!,Subaru
—wha?,Subaru
Emilia...?,Subaru
"Emilia! Emilia!? Wh, why are, why!?",Subaru
"Ghu, uw, au...",Subaru
Did fucking Echidna actually seriously think it'd go like this...?,Subaru
"—uegh, geh",Subaru
I was able to come back...,Subaru
"It's so much better than some... can't-come-back, unrecoverable state.",Subaru
...What?,Subaru
Hands and teeth are shaking... what's with this...,Subaru
"Knowing that much... but my body's, still shaking...",Subaru
—,Subaru
—,Subaru
"...It'll be the end, then.",Subaru
"That's just ordinary, happens to everyone.",Subaru
"...h, no...",Emilia
—Emilia.,Subaru
"...Subah, rhu?",Emilia
"—Yeah, it's me.",Subaru
Umm...,Emilia
"This is... I, was just...",Emilia
...Subaru?,Emilia
How come you look like you're about to cry?,Emilia
...wh?,Subaru
"a, ue, e?",Subaru
"It's okay, Subaru. It's alright, everything's okay. I'm here—",Emilia
Calmed down?,Emilia
"Uh, uh-huh... um, I'm sorry. For causing trouble in this, weird way.",Subaru
"No,",Emilia
Why not?,Emilia
"I'm not going to think of you like that, just by seeing you being a little weak.",Emilia
Tearjerk... what?,Emilia
"So, now I kinda wanna ask about the TRIAL...",Subaru
—Right.,Emilia
Guess even my weakness can be helpful...,Subaru
"Subaru, why are you here? The only one who can enter here should be...",Emilia
"Nope, I...",Subaru
"Then, right... I'm sorry, I worried you.",Emilia
"Ah,",Emilia
...Talking like that isn't any good.,Emilia
Sorry.,Subaru
"By the way,",Subaru
Can I ask? About the TRIAL.,Subaru
...I'm sorry. I think I failed it.,Emilia
"That's... yeah, kinda figured that from your reaction.",Subaru
So everything's over now... is what it's wound up being?,Subaru
"No, nevermind. Today looks like it was no good, but I'll try again tomorrow.",Emilia
"...Talking might make it easier, 's the kinda know-it-all line I'll be trying here.",Subaru
"—Sorry. I don't want to show these feelings to you, Subaru.",Emilia
"You did excellent work, Barusu.",Ram
"Ow! Hey, au, that hurts!",Subaru
That's... all?,Subaru
Eh? What. Yer sayin' y'want me t'pat yer head 's reward fer puttin' in work?,Garfiel
The problem of how I should interact with you is puzzling my brain.,Subaru
"Yer sayin' things that don't make sense, oi.",Garfiel
—,Lewes
Filthy.,Ram
For immediately coming up with that you're the filthy one!,Subaru
Refrain from talks that would burden her too much.,Ram
Meening?,Subaru
"Subaru, did you maybe... inside, with the TRIAL too...",Emilia
Waking me?,Emilia
"Then... right. I'm sorry, for that weird doubt.",Emilia
...I don't know. We might not necessarily have seen the same thing...,Emilia
"Anyway, what is the talk about? That couldn't have been the main topic, right?",Emilia
Right. That's not the main topic. So there's something I wanna ask.,Subaru
You want to ask?,Emilia
"Yeah, wanna ask.",Subaru
Puck hasn't been showing up for a while... is he still not responding?,Subaru
No ideas on what the cause is?,Subaru
"—. I don't, really have any ideas, I guess.",Emilia
What do you want to talk about with Puck?,Emilia
"Okey. I've got my expectations for you on that, Emilia-tan.",Subaru
But I don't want to sleep together?,Emilia
"Hit with such a sincere comeback, and even I... can only say 'wooahh'.",Subaru
Hm?,Subaru
"No, nevermind. Have a good night. Take care.",Emilia
That last part's really not a joke. 'Night.,Subaru
"Actually, can I have a minute with you too?",Subaru
Filthy.,Ram
Is the me inside you really such an indiscriminate beast?,Subaru
"Saying this's something, but my perspective in viewing you's basically never been filthy.",Subaru
"...So, is there anything you want to ask me?",Ram
Weuh?,Subaru
"Can't have that. ...Right, yeah. I sorta wanted to ask about Garfiel.",Subaru
Did something happen with Garf?,Ram
I see. ...I'll choose to leave it merely as that.,Ram
"So, what about Garf do you want to ask?",Ram
...That is certainly a strange subject you've chosen.,Ram
"Love's the weak point, huh. I had that idea too so I can't say anything.",Subaru
"But, Ram. That's probably...",Subaru
Right. Likely useless.,Ram
"Garfiel's number one is something else, too...? Do you?",Subaru
I do know. But I won't tell you.,Ram
...Where did you hear about that?,Ram
"Depending on the course and circumstances, I may soon give you a painful experience.",Ram
"Your eyes have come to be sickening, Barusu.",Ram
Oh?,Subaru
...What I saw in the tomb was a kind of hope for me. Don't label it as nothing good.,Subaru
Do leave now. I could not bear to make Emilia-sama wait for any longer.,Ram
...Sorry for holding you up. I do know what you're saying isn't wrong.,Subaru
—,Subaru
Man you're a pretty timely bastard.,Subaru
Yer sure don't look surprised.,Garfiel
"That frickin' obviously meant 'follow me', oi!",Garfiel
"Just a cheeky joke. Not like I didn't see it, relax.",Subaru
"'M sayin' that pisses me off. Just come on, gonna eat yer.",Garfiel
Wouldn't you usually say 'I won't eat you' to make me relax here?,Subaru
Now... The fuck'd you see in the tomb?,Garfiel
...You too with that.,Subaru
"Me too, huh?",Garfiel
I sure get plenty of people pointing out that witch's lingering scent thing.,Subaru
...Yer didn't answer my first question.,Garfiel
Hm?,Subaru
"Then, first let me ask you a question.",Subaru
"No getting mad. Let your shoulders untense, and answer completely at ease.",Subaru
"—I saw a girl who looks exactly like Lewes-san, would you know anything about that?",Subaru
You... Fuck'd you just say?,Garfiel
That sure fucking got you livid.,Subaru
—Two of them.,Subaru
Eh?,Garfiel
—Ghhau!,Subaru
—Where did you see that?,Garfiel
"Where's not a question... I said, in the forest...",Subaru
"Th... at'll, be dependant on your attitude...",Subaru
"You can... end me here hearing nothing, but it won't solve anything.",Subaru
...Yer cracked.,Garfiel
"D-don't just suddenly let go, startles people.",Subaru
"Shut it, headcase. Don't fuckin' joke. Were you fuckin' testin' my amazin' self?",Garfiel
Testinngg?,Subaru
"You were talkin', thinkin' I might kill you.",Garfiel
"Say so much and it does hurt. ...And, it's not like I'm doing this unperturbed.",Subaru
"If my life alone is enough, then that balances to the results.",Subaru
Do you maybe feel like answering my question?,Subaru
Dunwanna.,Garfiel
"Really now. Oh well, nothing going then.",Subaru
"Yer... you wanted t'know, th...",Garfiel
"...What're,",Garfiel
...Probably no point talking any further.,Subaru
"But, well,",Subaru
"Do you still feel like stopping me, Garfiel?",Subaru
If you do then all it creates is a detour. It'd help if you didn't.,Subaru
You...,Garfiel
"...I got no idea what you're goddamn sayin'. Yer fuckin' exactly, entirely like them.",Garfiel
Might be worth it.,Subaru
...Eh?,Garfiel
—! You...!,Garfiel
Not knowing it means it's to learn. Think that's why I'm doing this.,Subaru
—,Subaru
Y'dunn'ven know how pain er suffering feel! End yer know-it-all talk!!,Garfiel
...I do know.,Subaru
—,Garfiel
"I know HELL. —I've seen it, so many, times.",Subaru
"I'm the only one who has to know hell. I'm here, for that.",Subaru
...Think it was somewhere around here.,Subaru
I'm pretty sure this is where Garfiel showed up back then.,Subaru
His good timing and his showing up from that direction's bothering me.,Subaru
"A trodden-down path... means,",Subaru
...Found it.,Subaru
"Huh. Last time I was here, I felt it was a little more destroyed...",Subaru
...Hey.,Subaru
Lewes-san?,Subaru
"Why... did this,",Subaru
Lewes-san... or isn't she?,Subaru
"Most likely candidate... is yeah, Garfiel.",Subaru
No clue at all what this facility was for.,Subaru
...au?,Subaru
"Oh, a Lewes-san...",Subaru
But that said...,Subaru
Can you understand what I'm saying?,Subaru
"Your name? Can I ask what you're here to do? And actually, what is this place?",Subaru
"...SANCTUARY, Garfiel, Lewes. Are any of these words familiar?",Subaru
...?,Subaru
—Uegh!,Subaru
"It's actually from inside that base... or basically, the area around the crystal.",Subaru
This's... when using magic.,Subaru
...A save point.,Subaru
"Hey, hold on a mo... ah, touched her.",Subaru
"...Thanatosis, would probably be way too optimistic here.",Subaru
"Again, powerless...",Subaru
—wha?,Subaru
"—Oa, au, agha!?",Subaru
"—heuh, u?",Subaru
"...Wh-what the hell, was...",Subaru
"There's, nothing. But, if there's nothing then why on earth...",Subaru
"Ah, cra...",Subaru
"What're you planning, all of a sudden?",Subaru
Uauh!?,Subaru
"...? You mean, follow me?",Subaru
"Nothing ventured nothing gained, I guess.",Subaru
"Talking to myself. —Alright, lead me along. I'll follow.",Subaru
"So it's not inside. I'm okay with going out, but...",Subaru
...Are you kidding me with this timing?,Subaru
"Yeah, let's. I've seriously, got way too many subjects piled up.",Subaru
Just seat yerself on the bed there. I'll make drinks fer us.,Lewes
If it's just tea how about I do it? Ram's trained it into me so I should be a little better.,Subaru
"I'd be more'en happy if yer could, but doesn't lerk like yer able at the moment.",Lewes
"No matter how much time passes, Pico's kind of not letting me go.",Subaru
"Well, you could say that, I suppose...",Subaru
"Here now, it's hot so let it cool befer drinking.",Lewes
"I'm not a kid, I'm not gonna drink it in a rush and burn myself.",Subaru
I can really taste the attempt to draw out the leaf flavour in this.,Subaru
I gotter feeling I been passed with a judgement that's sure nothing fair.,Lewes
"Just your feeling, just your feeling.",Subaru
"Now that we're calmed down, can we be alright to start the talk?",Subaru
"Mm. I've got loster things I needer talk about from my side, too.",Lewes
I still haven't figured out the true issue that I need to ask about.,Subaru
That building... that facility from before. Just what on earth is it?,Subaru
Hrm. ...That's the question yer starting with.,Lewes
The reason SANCTUARY exists!?,Subaru
Roswaal is...,Subaru
Who made this place is the Witch of GREED... it'd be Echidna.,Subaru
"Lil' Su, don't yer already have a success of the experiment right in fronter yer?",Lewes
"The outcome of this place is... you, Lewes-san, and this girl.",Subaru
"Yer really a kind boy, Lil' Su. Ertherwise soft. —Yer can just say experimental results.",Lewes
"There wers a girl who lerks exactly like me, sealed inside the crystal, yes?",Lewes
Just a smidgen.,Subaru
Jerst a smidgen.,Lewes
—What relation do you have to the girl in the crystal?,Subaru
It ersn't jerst about me. This girl here's in my persition too.,Lewes
"And the girl in the crystal, too.",Subaru
"No, just her is different. Becerrs the girl in the crystal is legitimate.",Lewes
"Legitimate, would mean what...",Subaru
"Acquired, individuality?",Subaru
Yes.,Lewes
Does hearing the word replica change how yer see me?,Lewes
"She's empty, is what...",Subaru
She doesn't need food?,Subaru
Is it mana... maybe?,Subaru
"Forcible algorithms, means?",Subaru
"Incredible... man, she was actually amazing.",Subaru
Yer expression's saying yer imagining something very heartwarming.,Lewes
"The next problem is, why was Echidna doing that?",Subaru
Hrm...,Lewes
I've hit on a thought for a possibility.,Subaru
Oh?,Lewes
"Delusion, isn't how I wanna dismiss it, but...",Subaru
"Lil' Su, yer a quicker thinker than I figured.",Lewes
"But, it seems yer overthink. Could also call yer a dreamer.",Lewes
"A dreamer... I don't think that opinion's too off-base, but...",Subaru
"That's... no, hold on.",Subaru
That's the result erv another test undergone in this SANCTUARY.,Lewes
...For what purpose?,Subaru
That's... no way.,Subaru
"—ah,",Subaru
"—To fill it, of course.",Subaru
—A kind of immortality.,Lewes
Immortality...,Subaru
Right. Having no insides... 'd mean there's no personality.,Subaru
What?,Lewes
"Really. Yeah. ...Yeah, well of course.",Subaru
"So that's what it is. Yeah, got it. Now I understand why you were being so forward, too.",Subaru
And just how different is that from me?,Subaru
Lil' Su?,Lewes
Aims...,Lewes
"Wh-why not? The personality download, sucking out the mental stuff, didn't succeed?",Subaru
"A different, cause being?",Subaru
"Vessel... wouldn't be a problem of bodily size, yeah?",Subaru
That... how did she confirm that?,Subaru
"Disposed... I, see.",Subaru
"But,",Lewes
"Though she searched fer a new method, the witch wers unable ter test it.",Lewes
"Befer the experiment in SANCTUARY could proceed, the Witch of ENVY started acting.",Lewes
...What happened to SANCTUARY after the witch was gone?,Subaru
Implanted personality... you can seriously do that?,Subaru
"And so, four Lewes-sans.",Subaru
"First... Right, I wanted to ask this too.",Subaru
Mm?,Lewes
What was Lewes Meyer thinking in participating in the experiment?,Subaru
Proposition... can I ask what it was about?,Subaru
"I doubt yer could understand it even if yer did ask, Lil' Su.",Lewes
Sanctuary's... continued existence?,Subaru
No but that... the arrangement's backwards.,Subaru
...That is overwhelmingly beyond help.,Subaru
Command right?,Subaru
Y-you were knowingly testing me!?,Subaru
...Hn?,Subaru
"Ummm,",Subaru
Excuse me. I'm afraid I have no idea what this apostle of GREED thing is.,Subaru
Inside the tomb...,Subaru
...It couldn'tve been the Chidna tea?,Subaru
"Hrm, Chidna tea?",Lewes
"Nert even jesting, it wers probably that.",Lewes
"Asshole, seriously what did she fucking make me drink!!",Subaru
"This thing even works on you, Lewes-san?",Subaru
I said I'm not a lolicon...,Subaru
"Lewes-san, I'm sorry for this being sudden, but... please help me out.",Subaru
"What, if it's something dirty go fer the purer lot, not me.",Lewes
Enough on that already.,Subaru
There has to be at least one other person than me with the command right.,Subaru
"I do wanna talk to him, but there's another thing that's been bothering me.",Subaru
Why did Gate Crossing throw me into that facility? I'd say now's about time to find out...,Subaru
"Wuah, daybreak... was a pretty content-heavy night.",Subaru
"What I really wanna do's go back to the cathedral and sleep till noon, but...",Subaru
"Leaving aside your enviable work schedule, there's no time. I can't do it.",Subaru
Can't rashly pull anything that'd probably make the Witch of ENVY show up...,Subaru
Seriously rather not risk others' lives to confirm that.,Subaru
"So, whatter yer planning ter do now, Lil' Su?",Lewes
"Frederica, hrm...",Lewes
"What, you happen to have some thoughts? About Frederica.",Subaru
...It's nerthing so important.,Lewes
Cogs started slipping?,Subaru
"I got expectations fer yer, Lil' Su.",Lewes
"What're you, of me...",Subaru
—,Subaru
"That's fine fer now. Fer now, that's still fine.",Lewes
"It's about the end erv my time, now.",Lewes
"T-their looks and speech'll be the same, but they'll be a different person, right?",Subaru
"Lil' Su, what're yer thoughts?",Lewes
—Huh?,Subaru
"I'm leaving the answer ter that question, as one of the things I'm expecting of yer.",Lewes
"Now then, Lil' Su... how der we move?",Lewes
"Right, yeah...",Subaru
"First, I wanna escape SANCTUARY. I'll be getting your help for that, Lewes-sans.",Subaru
"Sorry for just leaving you here, Patrasche.",Subaru
"But man, it's a sloppy plan presupposing a re-do...",Subaru
—That I still left Emilia a goodbye note's just weak of me.,Subaru
"'Cause it's not logical, so.",Subaru
"Better than nothing... Or, guess it's an 'if Emilia weren't so dependant on me' thing.",Subaru
"Now, to get outta here quick before anyone finds m... hm?",Subaru
"Betelgeux's gospel, huh...",Subaru
"Actually, that chat with Roswaal's changed my perspective on this thing a lot.",Subaru
"I, can read it?",Subaru
"What... no way, the book accepted me as its owner? But I didn't do...",Subaru
Did that fucking Echidna do something to me?,Subaru
"Dunno if that was the reason, but last loop's changes were bigger than ever too.",Subaru
"...But, maybe I'm not necessarily the owner.",Subaru
"In Mathers' domain, Trial on silver-haired half-witch... huh. Don't understand it.",Subaru
"...Right, my bad my bad. We'll get going right away.",Subaru
"Somehow I figured you'd be getting in the way, Garfiel.",Subaru
"That's your facade, right?",Subaru
—,Garfiel
"What're yer mean with that, oi.",Garfiel
Do you actually sense the witch's smell from me?,Subaru
...Eh? Fuck're you saying?,Garfiel
—,Garfiel
My secrets...?,Garfiel
"Au, ah?",Garfiel
"Seeing this, you do understand my position now, yeah?",Subaru
"Why... how'd you, that place!",Garfiel
"Regret and agony as sacrifices, summoned has been the truth. And my turn's not over yet.",Subaru
"—a,",Garfiel
Do... don't fuck with me. Do yer think this's gonna make my amazin' self give...,Garfiel
"Oh you'll stop. Fundamentally, you're a softy.",Subaru
—!?,Garfiel
"Yeah, this helped. Figured Garfiel would never think of this idea.",Subaru
"You, fucker!",Garfiel
I'm sorry for making you do this.,Subaru
"But still, I'm sorry.",Subaru
"Wait! Wait up! You, don't fuckin' joke 'round, oi!!",Garfiel
—,Lewes
Nanna—!!,Garfiel
...Your return certainly came quickly.,Frederica
"That much care's really not nee... oh, actually, please do that.",Subaru
"Yeah, please do that. —Right, Frederica.",Subaru
Yes?,Frederica
—Are you planning to go to the mountain cabin today?,Subaru
...? I am not. Would there be something the matter?,Frederica
"Nevermind,",Subaru
Understood. I will return at once.,Frederica
"Before the end can come, I have to find a way to put an end to the end.",Subaru
Woah! You certainly returned quick!,Petra
"Petra, this's sudden, but... can I ask you for a favour?",Subaru
"...? Sure. I mean, yes. When it's your request, Subaru-sama, I'll answer to anything.",Petra
Big Sis Frederica will be there as well?,Petra
"Not, uninvolved...",Petra
"Then, this is an important talk for me and you, Subaru-sama?",Petra
"But, for that, the feelings of those involved are very important.",Petra
At once! I will return at once! Don't you run away!,Petra
"I'm not running anywhere, but Petra if you go too fast you'll trip.",Subaru
Petra!,Subaru
"Really? Subaru, I helped you?",Petra
"Yup, saved my life... or well no, but something like that.",Subaru
"Either way, it's thanks to you, Petra. Gotta show my gratitude for it somehow.",Subaru
"Then, a dayt! One dayt!",Petra
"Er, did you hear about those from Emilia?",Subaru
It's a promise!,Petra
Oui oui.,Subaru
"We'll definitely make that promise again, Petra.",Subaru
"But, Big Sis Frederica...",Petra
Uuw...,Petra
Why must I leave the mansion?  And I've only been working here for a week and a bit...,Petra
"And you cannot discuss why, can you now?",Frederica
I'll be fine! Subaru'll protect me!,Petra
"...Yes, Big Sis Frederica.",Petra
Uuw...,Petra
"Wh-what I may ably do... would not be, at the mansion?",Petra
"Right, I will be doing that. When the problem's all resolved...",Subaru
"Am I fine to ask, Frederica?",Subaru
"That would depend upon the subject in question, Subaru-sama.",Frederica
What do you think Garfiel wants to do with SANCTUARY?,Subaru
—Has something occurred between yourself and my foolish younger brother?,Frederica
"Lewes-san didn't deny it either. You know Lewes-san, yeah?",Subaru
"You got Garfiel fucking calling her granny the granny the granny, too.",Subaru
Is Garfiel just maybe a bit of a nan's boy?,Subaru
Subaru-sama?,Frederica
To already know this much...,Frederica
You don't know? Really? Not changing that answer?,Subaru
"Dyuplicates... is it? No, I have never heard of such a thing.",Frederica
"—Ah,",Subaru
"Frederica. —Garfiel's challenged the TRIAL before, yeah?",Subaru
—! Why do you—,Frederica
You've never gone in?,Subaru
I absolutely need to see Echidna at least one more time.,Subaru
"Sorry,",Subaru
For everything. I think I asked things you didn't want asking.,Subaru
I bid you may care well for my foolish younger brother.,Frederica
And it's gonna be me going improv again...,Subaru
"Subaru-sama, what shall you now do?",Frederica
"Right,",Subaru
"Frederica, you haven't seen Beatrice even once since you came back... yeah?",Subaru
"If she's seriously hiding, nobody'll find the right door. That's fact.",Subaru
Not hiding seriously?,Frederica
Subaru-sama...,Frederica
"And so, the unveiling.",Subaru
For your return shall I await. Graciously I wish you well.,Frederica
Nice. Might even mistake myself for someone with rank.,Subaru
"Hey, Beako. Haven't seen you in ages, but you're still tiny as ever.",Subaru
"So that's what it is, I suppose,",Beatrice
"Do what you will, in fact. Since either way...",Beatrice
Make end the end of the end... right. That's sure pretty poetic.,Subaru
Is you having that know-it-all expression also thanks to that book?,Subaru
"...It's you who should be speaking. How much do you know about this book, I suppose?",Beatrice
"State what you're trying to say clearly, in fact.",Beatrice
"Here I go stating it clearly then, your position here is ridiculously unclear.",Subaru
"...Who, I suppose?",Beatrice
—It's Echidna.,Subaru
"Now, I have a question. About your Gate Crossing.",Subaru
"...I don't know what would happen should you hear the response, in fact.",Beatrice
There aren't any other conditions to it?,Subaru
"Do you think Betty has any reason to so nicely tell you, I suppose?",Beatrice
"...op,",Beatrice
...on't I suppose.,Beatrice
"—I want you to stop already, in fact!",Beatrice
"No,",Subaru
Beatrice... You are a spirit in contract with who?,Subaru
—!,Beatrice
"...a,",Beatrice
—Are you a spirit in contract with Echidna?,Subaru
Bea—!?,Subaru
The gospel's... huh?,Subaru
Wha... huh? Blank...?,Subaru
"No, that ridiculous...",Subaru
"It's a gospel... but, nothing's written?",Subaru
"It's been... so long, in fact.",Beatrice
—Huh?,Subaru
"Since that gospel stopped indicating Betty any future, already, years...",Beatrice
"Archive of knowledge... you mean, this place?",Subaru
Are all of these books Echidna's?,Subaru
"She was someone... who liked gathering knowledge, in fact.",Beatrice
"When it's escalated and she's introducing herself as a witch, I'm sure you're right.",Subaru
"By your wording... it seems you've entered the tomb, I suppose.",Beatrice
...So you kinda said the gospel hasn't been telling you the future for years.,Subaru
"It's the truth, in fact.",Beatrice
"That Betty... with you... gave you... assistance, was...",Beatrice
"With no relation to the gospel, you...",Subaru
"—at the end I was told, in fact.",Beatrice
"That one day, THEY would visit Betty's archive. For me to guard the archive until then.",Beatrice
...They?,Subaru
Betty can't tell. Whether you are THEY or not. …But.,Beatrice
"Wait, Beatrice. You're getting a little way too hasty. Now just calm down...",Subaru
"Whether you are THEY, or are not THEY... it doesn't matter, I suppose.",Beatrice
"You might not be THEY, but I already don't care any more, in fact. And so.",Beatrice
Bea—,Subaru
"You, be THEY.",Beatrice
—,Subaru
"What, did... you just say?",Subaru
"...a,",Subaru
"As you wish, I'll say it again, I suppose.",Beatrice
W-wait...,Subaru
"—Betty wants, by your hands, to be made ended, in fact.",Beatrice
Stop!!,Subaru
What the fuck do you think you're saying right now...,Subaru
"Do you comprehend what you're being told right now, I suppose?",Beatrice
What?,Subaru
I don't understand... You really saying you wanna die?,Subaru
"Certainly a selfish complaint, I suppose. —What would you know about Betty, in fact?",Beatrice
"Four, hundred years...",Subaru
But...,Subaru
...Beatrice.,Subaru
"During the period I did that, I realised, in fact. ...No, I had already realised, I suppose.",Beatrice
Realised what?,Subaru
"That Betty would never see the gospel's next writ, in fact.",Beatrice
"Did you know, I suppose?",Beatrice
Gospels write the future of their owner.,Beatrice
World's memories?,Subaru
So why'd you bring up the Witch Cult then?,Subaru
"You have a cult gospel, I suppose?",Beatrice
"Have you looked over that book's text, I suppose?",Beatrice
"—Final passing, isn't what I'd call it.",Subaru
"—That's what I thought, in fact.",Beatrice
"Has the gospel appended with any more writing after that, I suppose?",Beatrice
"—The gospel writing nothing further, means that is where owner's future ends, in fact.",Beatrice
Y-you and him aren't anything alike...,Subaru
You're wro—!,Subaru
"Why, 're you... doing that!",Subaru
"So many times, on you, I... and so this time, I'll...!",Subaru
"...I want, something done about it.",Beatrice
"Yes... just like that, call out.",Subaru
I want help...,Beatrice
"Yes! Yes, yesyesyes! Now if you just reach out...",Subaru
"I'm sad, I'm suffering... Betty, wants to be saved from this darkness.",Beatrice
"Right, leave it all to me—",Subaru
—,Beatrice
"I, no matter what—",Subaru
And so...,Beatrice
"—Betty wants you to kill her, in fact.",Beatrice
—,Subaru
"I've been alone... constantly, for four hundred years, I suppose.",Beatrice
B-beahthri....,Subaru
I want help? I want something done about it?,Beatrice
"—a,",Subaru
"If you... are doing that for me, then... why is it... why, is it...",Beatrice
—You left Betty alone for four hundred years!?,Beatrice
—hk,Subaru
D-don't—don't lump me in with those people! All I want to do is...,Subaru
"But they were incapable of bringing Betty out, in fact. Of course they'd be, I suppose.",Beatrice
"What, should I...",Subaru
—Make Betty your number one.,Beatrice
"Wha, t?",Subaru
—,Subaru
"This is impossible for you, in fact.",Beatrice
Emilia... Rem...,Subaru
"That's... Betty's reason for living, in fact.",Beatrice
"The contract, is?",Subaru
"I know... that you're not the contract's THEY, I suppose...",Beatrice
—,Subaru
—,Subaru
"Betty is the one who knows best that it's hopeless, in fact.",Beatrice
Beatrice...,Subaru
"Why, me...?",Subaru
"Why are you trying, to entrust your last moment, the end of four hundred years, to me...",Subaru
Why... I suppose.,Beatrice
"—Yes, I've got it, in fact.",Beatrice
"Betty entrusting her end to you, is surely... surely...",Beatrice
W-hy... 're you here!?,Subaru
"—Who gave you permission to be here, I suppose?",Beatrice
—!,Beatrice
"Your, knife... is wet, with whose blood?",Subaru
You goddamn...,Subaru
ELSAAAAAAAAAA!!,Subaru
Who the hell would rush straight-on into a monster like you!,Subaru
—Shamac!!,Subaru
Beatrice!,Subaru
—Phaa!,Subaru
"Knew, that'd do it—!",Subaru
"Wanna say I goddamn nailed it, but...",Subaru
Beatrice! Connect that door to some different door—,Subaru
"Fuck, right!",Subaru
"What do I do, what do I do what do I do whatdoIdowhatdoIdowhaddaIdo—",Subaru
"Why couldn't one more day... no, she didn't even give us a handful of hours!",Subaru
"That isn't hope, it's not letting go, I suppose...",Beatrice
"Wanting to see a spirit's guts is crossing the line for poor taste, in fact.",Beatrice
"What are you planning to do now, I suppose?",Beatrice
Fuck it! Just come here!,Subaru
"...Let me go, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Anyway, before Elsa shows up... we have to find Petra and Rem!",Subaru
"My belief was this mansion had another maid in it, in fact.",Beatrice
Frederica's... it's best we don't meet her right now. I think.,Subaru
"Peh, trra...",Subaru
"—ue,",Subaru
"I'm so sorry... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... Petra...",Subaru
"And for that as well, I can't let this try just end like this...",Subaru
This try?,Beatrice
—So that's how it is.,Subaru
Do you know where the Forbidden Archive is connected to right now?,Subaru
"Don't have the spare time to be panic. Anyway, we're hurrying to Rem—.",Subaru
"Frederica, likely'll be there...",Subaru
"This has been bothering me, in fact. ...Are you doubting that big maid, I suppose?",Beatrice
"...Not that I wanted to, though.",Subaru
And when Petra was so goddamn attached to you!,Subaru
"Anyway, now is getting to Rem. If Frederica's there... am I okay to count on you?",Subaru
Let's go.,Subaru
"Mm, right, I suppose.",Beatrice
—,Subaru
And so all there is now is busting straight though.,Subaru
"—That softness will give you a terrible experience soon, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Endure it, body of mine. —Shamac!",Subaru
"...Something's strange, in fact.",Beatrice
—,Subaru
...Why?,Subaru
Doubted her utterly... and for this.,Subaru
—I was wrong.,Subaru
...Rem.,Subaru
"If you think you'll get us so easily, you best think again, in fact.",Beatrice
"We'll test on you whether these are any children's toy, in fact.",Beatrice
"The one who has failed to think is you in fact, human.",Beatrice
—This!,Beatrice
—,Subaru
"—Dghuh, au?",Subaru
"Why!? But I got a direct hit, I suppose!?",Beatrice
ELSAAAAA!!,Subaru
"Uninjured is inconceivable, in fact.",Beatrice
Her magic nullifying coat!,Subaru
Fuck!,Subaru
"Once you know the trick, it isn't anything shocking, in fact.",Beatrice
You don't have any fucking right to mock Petra!!,Subaru
I'll wring out everything I've got! SHAMAC!!,Subaru
Now hit her—!,Subaru
Beako!!,Subaru
"Don't spontaneously call me that, I suppose—!",Beatrice
"Here I will show you, in fact. —What true yin magic is.",Beatrice
—Ul Shamac.,Beatrice
—?,Subaru
S-stop punching me!,Subaru
"Aauh, ow... Um, can you do like a targeted Shamac?",Subaru
Anyway...,Subaru
"What happened to Elsa? You're leisurely, so that means she retreated?",Subaru
"What on earth are you saying, I suppose?",Beatrice
"That your powers of perception are this poor is pretty pitiful, in fact.",Beatrice
"If you don't understand it, then look clearly with your own eyes, I suppose.",Beatrice
"—ue, oe,",Subaru
"You ask what happened to the terrifying opponent, in fact?",Beatrice
She's dead... right?,Subaru
S-sorry...,Subaru
It's fine...,Beatrice
S-she's really dead...?,Subaru
"That's what I've been telling you, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Puck and Emilia took her on together and still couldn't finish her off, this chick.",Subaru
"Ri, ght. Rem!",Subaru
—Rem.,Subaru
"...I am so sorry for doubting you, Frederica.",Subaru
"What will you do now, I suppose?",Beatrice
"You're fine to do that, in fact. She would be delighted too, I suppose.",Beatrice
If your objections were what you really felt then I would give them some thought.,Subaru
"—What do you mean, in fact?",Beatrice
"—Don't, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Stop, probing in fact.",Beatrice
"How far do you intend to go in making idiots of people, I suppose...!",Beatrice
Idiots? That wasn't what I was tr...,Subaru
—,Subaru
—oe?,Subaru
"—a,",Beatrice
"—Wh,",Subaru
"...Now,",Beatrice
Finally...,Beatrice
Wai...,Subaru
"—u,",Beatrice
—ELSAAAAAAA!!,Subaru
Wh-y... the fuck're you alive. I was pretty damn sure I confirmed you dead...!,Subaru
"No way... you don't mean, your body's immortal...",Subaru
...Then would you like to pretend you hadn't seen her and overlook this?,Subaru
"Yeah, you fucking liar.",Subaru
Huh? —Ghbha!?,Subaru
...I don't wanna hear any lectures on life and death from you.,Subaru
—Beatrice.,Subaru
"Thh, hies...",Subaru
"No way... I, didn't die?",Subaru
"Elsa, 's...",Subaru
"Why, would... no, more importantly...",Subaru
—Rem.,Subaru
—,Subaru
"Why, did she leave... without killing me or Rem...?",Subaru
But then... why me...?,Subaru
"Anyway, for now...",Subaru
"But rationalize it as an ending world, and there's no point...",Subaru
"Hell, what?",Subaru
Huge—,Subaru
Hell is this...?,Subaru
Where did all the villagers go?,Subaru
Ultimately though it's probably just my self-satisfaction.,Subaru
"—Everyone's, gone.",Subaru
"No one's here so, nothing to do here. ...Have to, bury them quick.",Subaru
"...At least, have peace.",Subaru
"And I caused you problems, too. Thank you, for helping me.",Subaru
...There's no point being here anymore.,Subaru
Before that happens... yeah.,Subaru
Let's go back to SANCTUARY. —I miss Emilia.,Subaru
Seriously don't do this... what the fuck is going on!?,Subaru
"So cold that everything in front of you's white... only, bad premonitions here. Patrasche.",Subaru
"Hey, Patrasche?",Subaru
Patrasche!,Subaru
"Patrasche. I'm sorry but could you leave the for... no, return all the way to the mansion?",Subaru
The road to SANCTUARY's dead ahead... yeah?,Subaru
"What happened here, Emilia...",Subaru
—,Subaru
"—au,",Subaru
"Lewes, -san?",Subaru
—,Lewes
"Perf, ect timin... Please guide, me to SANCTUARY.",Subaru
Garfiel.,Subaru
"Eh? Hell's Ram doin' with... no, that ain't Ram. Eh? What's goin' on here? Who's she?",Garfiel
What do you mean she isn't going to listen to me?,Subaru
The command right transfers that easily?,Subaru
Th'point 's ya just touch it. S'the same damn thing 's what you musta did.,Garfiel
It was really considerate of you to go out of your way to welcome me.,Subaru
"Okay, yeah. ...So, kinda asking point-blank here.",Subaru
—Is Emilia doing this?,Subaru
"Ain't got any clue. 'Cause after all, she ain't comin' outta th'tomb.",Garfiel
She isn't coming out of the tomb?,Subaru
You know about Emilia's...!,Subaru
That expression 's fucking pathetic.,Garfiel
Wha—!?,Subaru
Y—Rem!,Subaru
"What're you, gonna... to Rem!",Subaru
"You get in the tomb. —And then, you pull the half-witch out.",Garfiel
You've sure got.. some rough treatment going here.,Subaru
Don't you do anything funny... with Rem.,Subaru
"So long's yer thinkin' t'follow my demands, I won't.",Garfiel
"Can we do something about their clothes? ...She looks so cold, I can't keep watching.",Subaru
How long has it been since Emilia went in?,Subaru
"From your position, I'm sure that's right. ...You couldn't go in and pull her out yourself?",Subaru
I can't go in th'tomb. There's a contract.,Garfiel
If I go in and ask Echidna... might find out.,Subaru
Don't do anything to Rem. —That's my condition.,Subaru
...Just go.,Garfiel
—,Subaru
Emilia.,Subaru
"Yes. You're right, Subaru. ...It's me.",Emilia
"Ss, war, sorr... lost, my strength...",Subaru
"E-Emilia... when I was away, um...",Subaru
—I was lonely.,Emilia
...Huh?,Subaru
"I was lonely, Subaru. —I mean, you left me behind.",Emilia
"Au... no, that... you're wrong. Abandoning you, or whatever wasn't what I...",Subaru
Heehee.,Emilia
"Nooo need to explain so hard, I won't be angry. Subaru, silly, your face's so pale... hehee.",Emilia
E-Emilia...?,Subaru
Emilia... what happened with the TRIAL?,Subaru

—,Subaru
"Eheheh. Mm, mhm... I like you. Subaru... love you.",Emilia
"Ain't lookin' like she's gonna be showin' up from 'hind yer back, oi.",Garfiel
"No, she's not. Emilia's inside, sleeping right now.",Subaru
"Sleepin', huh?",Garfiel

"—So well Emilia, she said she likes me.",Subaru
...,Garfiel
...,Garfiel
...,Garfiel
...Huh?,Garfiel

"Eh? Can't hear ya, try speakin' cle...",Garfiel
—As fucking if Emilia would say she likes me!!,Subaru
—hk,Garfiel
"F-fuck're you goin' on about, oi.",Garfiel
There's no question whose fault it was. ...It's my fault.,Subaru
—Hha!?,Garfiel
You'll go in the tomb and bring Emilia out... will you? Are you actually able to?,Subaru
...What're you gettin' at.,Garfiel
"—You, fuck.",Garfiel
—hk,Garfiel
"Frederica told me you'd entered the tomb before. I know Lewes-san's been inside, too.",Subaru
"Th, at... snitch! Just leavin' th'place was't enough for her, she's toadyin' t'outsiders again!",Garfiel
I ain't allowin'—,Garfiel
—The one causing this snow is Roswaal.,Subaru
—,Garfiel
"Th, at's... another're, one're your convenient imagination...",Garfiel
The one binding you all to SANCTUARY's also probably Roswaal.,Subaru
"Did Frederica tell you that one, too?",Garfiel
—,Garfiel
Gotta go directly have his face eat a good whack.,Subaru
"—Why now, yooooou certainly doooooo look mad.",Roswaal
"Nooo, nooo.",Roswaal
"This is how it is when that is how it is, yooooou see, Subaru-kun?",Roswaal
"You're who's making it snow outside, Roswaal.",Subaru

"Hhr, hrm.... Well then. Well then. Weeeeeelll then. ...Unfortunate.",Roswaal
"Not fuckin' denyin' it, oi?.",Garfiel

"Noooooo, but that iiiiiiiiisn't it, Subaru-kun. Subaru-kun. Natsuki Subaru-kuuuuuuuun.",Roswaal
What do you want to say.,Subaru
You were waiting... for me to be standing here?,Subaru
"That only I... can under, stand.",Subaru

"—Because they're recoverable, wooooooould be what you're thinking?",Roswaal
You...,Subaru
"...Won't, come.",Subaru
"Make sense... or no, before that!",Subaru
"You... noticed my—noticed, what's going on with me!?",Subaru
"—Silence is proven admission, is a phrase I wonder just whoooooo left to the ages.",Roswaal
Y—,Subaru
"You might've been frightened, of how revealing it would make others regard you.",Roswaal
—hk,Subaru
"—Seeing that reaction, iiiiiiiiit would seem that Beatrice fulfilled heeeeeer role.",Roswaal
"Role... you, about her... right.",Subaru
Then...!,Subaru
"Enviable, iiiiiiiindeed.",Roswaal
—Enviable?,Subaru
Yes.,Roswaal
—,Subaru
"Your... dearest wish, is...?",Subaru

Why!!,Subaru
It's entirely obvious. —To isolate Emilia-sama.,Roswaal
"—Wh, haa?",Subaru

"Wait... wait.. wait, wait waitwaitwait...",Subaru
That—,Subaru
"Thinking to, kill me, then?",Subaru
Whe—?,Subaru
"—Everyone, inside!!",Subaru
I had thought the command right was in Garfiel's possession?,Roswaal
I was diving into where you the maybe-mastermind'd be. —Bolstered my playable cards.,Subaru
Now what are you planning to do wiiiiiiiiiith me surrounded?,Roswaal
—While indeed I am outnumbered.,Roswaal
—,Subaru
"You, using magic shouldn't be poss...",Subaru
"Wha—ghhu, gaaeh.",Subaru
Hhgg—,Subaru
"Rhouz, wahl... you're, asking over and over for me to REDO, but...",Subaru

"If that's right then, fine. But, if it is, then we could...",Subaru
—It doesn't appear that wiiiiiiiill be happening.,Roswaal
Goa.,Roswaal
"—No, way.",Subaru
Iiiiiii see. ...So this is how the end comes.,Roswaal
"Sizeable, hare...!!",Subaru
"But, it's still the fifth day... there should've been over half a day left!",Subaru
It's the snow.,Roswaal
Snow—!?,Subaru
Then...,Subaru
Th-the cathedral! We have to hurry to the cathedral!,Subaru
But! That's where...!,Subaru
Flee? Where? There's a barrier. The people of SANCTUARY cannot flee.,Roswaal

"Risk yourselves, protect me. —Once we reach the tomb, do whatever you want.",Subaru

"Then it was you, Subaru! Gosh, just where'd you go? I was worried.",Emilia
...Are you tired?,Emilia
"Yeah... might, little bit... tired.",Subaru
"Heehee, right. Ok then, ok then.",Emilia
"Now, here you go, Subaru.",Emilia
"...A, lap pillow.",Subaru
What number are we up to for me giving you a lap pillow?,Emilia
"Dunno. ...Third, maybe. Somehow always, when I'm drained ragged.",Subaru
"I have fun fiddling around with like, your hair, or your face, though. Liiike, fiddlefiddle.",Emilia

"You bastard, what did you see in the tomb... yeah?",Subaru
"Out of all the sayings you've said, there's the nastiest one, right there.",Subaru
Inside I took the TRIAL. I saw my past.,Subaru
"—! So y'did have th'fucking qualifications... Then, yr'results're...",Garfiel
Well you sure look pretty fucking relieved.,Subaru
Eh?,Garfiel

This's coming with my speculations too.,Subaru
"—Y'know, why won't you reattempt the TRIAL?",Subaru
—,Garfiel
I'm thinking to hopefully get your help.,Subaru
"—Do, n't say th's stupid crap.",Garfiel
You do realise that how that position crazy doesn't suit you?,Subaru
It ain't a thing of suit'n er not suitin'. 'S necessary so it's what I do.,Garfiel
"Even if I told you that outside, your help is necessary?",Subaru
"I've got mountains of things to think over... but,",Subaru
"This included, thinking over everything alone's gonna get me nowhere.",Subaru
Guess it's time to rely on you again...,Subaru
If you wish... that you want to know...,Subaru

—Yeah probably would.,Puck
"Well, nevermind it. You don't need to understand it... since anyway, you're dying here.",Puck

That's not really getting to the point or actually no before that...,Subaru
"I'm not gonna do that. Not gonna do it, but... what were you plotting with that?",Subaru
"Putting on Rem's shape, and standing in front of me! Is that what your power is!?",Subaru
Man transformation's a really orthodox power compared to the other witches.,Subaru
What?,Subaru
Do you... do you understand what the fuck it is you just did?,Subaru
Listen to me!!,Subaru
Can you not hear that I'm telling you to listen!!,Subaru
—!?,Subaru

"...What were you trying to do, goading that witch on like that.",Subaru
...Why did you pull that?,Subaru
—,Subaru
...Get back to explaining.,Subaru
What?,Subaru
—,Subaru
No appetite for 'Chidna tea. ...But I will be getting a profitable conversation out of you.,Subaru

There is no one who can forgive me.,Subaru
There is no one who can judge me.,Subaru

"Con, tract...?",Subaru
"We form this... say we formed this, what happens?",Subaru
"...You're dead, and so, aren't you incapable of interfering with reality?",Subaru
Are you hitting me with a surprise fast-lipped sales pitch?,Subaru
"Maybe, it wouldn't be so bad...",Subaru
How do you tie a contract?,Subaru
"Now, let's hope things're gonna start changing...",Subaru
Why're you here?,Subaru
"Well no. I'm not, but... I mean, Echidna's right there.",Subaru
"And so then... but, no, you...",Subaru
"Wh, aeh?",Subaru

—Dhah!?,Subaru
"A, auh! Wai, this hurts this hurts this hurts... or not?",Subaru
A-and so that's why the aching over my body's... not.,Subaru
What the hell're you trying to do here...,Subaru
"No, but... saying detriments... something, that kind of serious...",Subaru
"Echidna. If we form the contract, you'll need compensation.",Subaru
"—Say, your, demand.",Subaru
"You're, not lying right?",Subaru
Minerva. This's what Echidna's telling me. And so what I'm doing is...,Subaru
Camilla... the WITCH OF LUST!,Subaru
The nasty eyes're inborn. I'm not making any specially harsh expression or anything.,Subaru
Hiding things?,Subaru
What've you all... what have you all been talking about!?,Subaru
Ultimately?,Subaru
"Do, whatev...",Subaru
"Echidna, if I contract you... without fail, you will take me to the optimum future, you said.",Subaru
Will your cooperating in getting me to the optimum future—use the optimum path?,Subaru
"For me to reach my desired destination, will you truly, help me the best you can?",Subaru
"Why're you saying nothing. Answer me, Echidna—no— WITCH OF GREED!",Subaru
—hk,Subaru
—,Subaru
Echidna.,Subaru
You're... going to use me?,Subaru
"It just, wasn't there...",Subaru
Was this your intention all along?,Subaru
"All your behaviour feels synthetic, it is superficial.",Subaru
You're actually not. You—You are someone who can't understand others' emotions.,Subaru
You're allowed to be angry here.,Subaru
"...In this situation, do you think I'll still readily consider a contract with you?",Subaru
There's one thing I wanted you ask you when I next saw you.,Subaru
"Once I hear this question's answer, I'll know if I can choose.",Subaru
"—You know about Beatrice, Echidna.",Subaru
"Then, who is THEY? What can I do to free her?",Subaru
"—Wh, ah?",Subaru
Even you don't know who it is Beatrice is waiting for?,Subaru
—,Subaru
Fundamental?,Subaru
—,Subaru
"—Th, at.",Subaru
—,Subaru
"What, do you think of that?",Subaru
Echidna... you are a witch.,Subaru
"An indecipherable, unfathomable aberration.",Subaru
I... I can't take your hand. I've already decided whose hand it is I'm taking.,Subaru
Yeah... the other witches don't compare.,Subaru
"Seen it a bunch of times now, but... what's the deal with this?",Subaru
—,Subaru
Why is she even here in the fir...,Subaru
—,Subaru
...,Subaru
...I don't understand what you're saying. What're all of you...,Subaru
Which one?,Subaru

"Get over here... you can say that, but...",Subaru
And Minerva...,Subaru
"What she wants to do, and why she came here. So long as I don't know that...!",Subaru
"Just, fuck... you're thinking stupid here, me...",Subaru

"What, really... are you? What do you want with me?",Subaru
"If you're the one giving me the power to redo... why, is that...",Subaru
—Ah?,Subaru

Stop...,Subaru
Please stop...,Subaru
I told you to fucking stop!,Subaru
What!?,Subaru

Sickening... unrepaid...?,Subaru
You! Are! Who did this to me!,Subaru
"Hopeless, situations...",Subaru
"Y , ou... that...",Subaru
"Fuck... are you, saying.",Subaru
"If we can welcome the future, without losing anyone, then... hk",Subaru
"...Rem is, gone.",Subaru
I have to believe... I have to believe there's some way I can do something...,Subaru
I! Don't want to lose anyone like how I lost Rem any more—!,Subaru

Seriously... just what are you all.,Subaru
...I don't know.,Subaru
"I have just, no idea what to do any more.",Subaru
Echidna.,Subaru
I'm afraid of being hurt.,Subaru
"And so, your hand which presupposes sacrifices—I can't take anymore.",Subaru
...huh?,Subaru
Echidna?,Subaru
...You guys are all a bunch beyond anything I can understand.,Subaru
RETURN BY DEATH is an option available to me... is what this all is?,Subaru
"Yeah. Compared to dying, it's nothing.",Subaru
"—Back outside, then.",Subaru
—,Subaru
—,Subaru
"—I,",Subaru
—,Subaru
"I, no matter what—",Subaru
—Will save you.,Subaru
...You.,Subaru
"But I was inside... why'm, outside?",Subaru
"That said, really doubt I crawled out myself, so who the...",Subaru
Well hello Natsuki-san. What is it you're doing out here?,Otto
Not unrelated to me?,Subaru
"And since she came to me, you're relaxed on that front.",Subaru
No leisure time for that. I didn't even hang out with her 'cept to give her her food...,Subaru
—,Subaru
Patrasche...,Subaru
Did you drag me out of the tomb?,Subaru
"Did, you seriously get yourself injured to pull me out?",Subaru
Otto.,Subaru
"Can you, please ask Patrasche why she helped me?",Subaru
"Honestly speaking, I'm not especially inclined, Natsuki-san.",Otto
"Don't say that, just please.",Subaru
"...Yeah, you got it.",Subaru
—,Subaru
"How about we flip this, you seriously think I look like I'm in a state to be joking?",Subaru
—,Subaru
"Stop teasing. I'm begging, please tell me.",Subaru
"Right, here it is. I've chosen the words that, probably, are the closet I can figure.",Otto
Right... and Patrasche was?,Subaru
"Ermm, SURELY YOU WOULDN'T MAKE ME SAY IT, is about what I have.",Otto
—wha?,Subaru
DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT... what's that...,Subaru
Listening?,Otto
Auh—,Subaru
"Ri, ght.. you, like me.",Subaru
"You love me, and that's why you're, here for me.",Subaru
"Oeu, awuh...",Subaru
Natsuki-san?,Otto
"Crying because you recognized your dragon is attached to you, Natsuki-san this...",Otto
"Didn't think I'd be getting the lesson from you. —Thank you, Patrasche.",Subaru
"Yeah, that helped a ton, thank you. ...am I alright?",Subaru
"Right, yeah. You... or, no.",Subaru
...What is it?,Otto
"Just remembered. Yeah, remembered. Remembered.",Subaru
"You get in danger, and you're zipping off ramshackle... huh.",Subaru
You wouldn't run.,Subaru
—Weh?,Otto
"—You wouldn't leave me and run, Otto.",Subaru
"Because, Otto. —You're my friend.",Subaru
Not gonna be getting any more help from Echidna now...,Subaru
"Treat yourself dearly, I mean it's fine saying it, but...",Subaru
Rely on those who think dearly of you... but how am I supposed to do that....,Subaru
—I goddamn said this isn't the time to be thinking about this.,Subaru
Garfiel's scared of the outside world... huh.,Subaru
—,Subaru
Mulling over it won't get me anywhere. ...I just have to do the things I can do.,Subaru
—,Subaru
—!?,Subaru
"Ghb, ghkk, haah, bahgh, uehgh",Subaru
"Aeu, uhg, what was, that?",Subaru
"What, is...",Subaru
"That shouldn't be... I mean, then that...",Subaru
Haah... haahh... hahh...,Subaru
"That, asshole...",Subaru
And that glimmer of hope is..!,Subaru
"Revoking my qualifications... you said nothing about this, ECHIDNAAA!!",Subaru
"So no, it wasn't my imagination or any kind of mistake...",Subaru
Saying to put Emilia through it... I think?,Subaru
"What do I do, what do I do, whatdoidowhatdoIdowhaddaIdowhat...",Subaru
Iiiiiiii certainly didn't expect for you to be visiting so late aaaaaaat night.,Roswaal
"Ahaaaa, how haaaaaarsh. But, well, yooooooou're not wrong in the slightest.",Roswaal
—,Roswaal
Subaru-kun. —What attempt are you currently on?,Roswaal
"Well, who could say.",Subaru
Right now in the middle of some trial and error. Kinda wanting your cooperation.,Subaru
Iiiiiiii see... that is indeed an answer tooooo my liking.,Roswaal
It's Echidna's barrier...,Subaru
"Aahaaaaaa, that dooooooes speed matters up.",Roswaal
Another opportunity? Why are you back tooooooo saying this?,Roswaal
Just try thinking about it.,Subaru
Doubts?,Subaru
Indeed.,Roswaal
"I kinda think this's changing track of the conversation, but...",Subaru
Hm? Yeeeeees?,Roswaal
Is there a reason for you to unconditionally want SANCTUARY freed?,Subaru
—,Roswaal
Noooooooow why is it you think that?,Roswaal
"Say why or say whatever,",Subaru
Actually I would like to ask you.,Roswaal
But?,Roswaal
I don't wanna see Emilia's heart wounded from challenging that TRIAL.,Subaru
"Nh, guh...",Subaru
That's not..!,Subaru
"...What you're saying's, in a sense, probably correct, Roswaal.",Subaru
In a sense?,Roswaal
Not enough...,Roswaal
—,Roswaal
...It seeeeeeeems your methods for polishing your resolve yet remain iiiiiiiinsufficient.,Roswaal
I wonder just how many more times... are you going tooooooo discourage me.,Roswaal
"Your, goal...",Subaru
...What's a way I can demonstrate my resolve that'll convince you?,Subaru
Is non-existent.,Roswaal
...That thing?,Subaru
"And you still think Emilia can't... then why, so then why did you bring her!?",Subaru
"I'm... the strongest, card?",Subaru
—hk!,Subaru
"Fine, yeah, I get what you're saying! But y'know! Your plan's still going nowhere!",Subaru
"Hm, and what would you...",Roswaal
"—Revoked, your qualifications?",Roswaal
What could it mean...,Roswaal
What could it? ...It means what it means.,Subaru
Does your gospel say that I beat the TRIAL?,Subaru
—,Roswaal
Ways to regain the qualifications...,Roswaal
Using your redo to return before the qualifications were revoked...?,Roswaal
"I, see...",Roswaal
...Weren't enough.,Roswaal
—Huh?,Subaru
—The methods I used for my cornering weren't enough.,Roswaal
What the?,Subaru
—,Subaru
"Wait, Roswaal. Wait.",Subaru

"Wait, please wait. Wa—",Subaru
"Beyond, my reach means...",Subaru
"Roswaal... are you actually, insane?",Subaru
Four hundred...?,Subaru
Natsuki Subaru-kun.,Roswaal
"Ah, auh...",Subaru
"Auh, ue.. sh-shut up!",Subaru
You should know best whether that is truly what you believe.,Roswaal
"Hold your conceit, Natsuki Subaru. You are not the only one who understands Echidna.",Roswaal
You're putting precedence on SANCTUARY's freedom because... that's Echidna's wish.,Subaru
Fuck off. I'm fine with revealing just what you're plotting and what the results of it'll be.,Subaru
—Leave the room. Living in this life no longer has meaning.,Roswaal
—,Subaru
—What should I do?,Subaru
"If Elsa's employer is Roswaal, then...",Subaru
—huh?,Subaru
"What? What... something's strange. But, what is it!?",Subaru
"No luck. —It's one step away, but not coming.",Subaru
Weh?,Subaru
"Oh, Emilia... -tan. What're you doing here. Pretty late out, y'know?",Subaru
"But that's the same for you too, Subaru. If you stay up too late, you won't grow any taller.",Emilia
"I think I've about finished puberty, so not super worried about that...",Subaru
"I couldn't get to sleep, so I kinda went out for a walk... what happened with you, Subaru?",Emilia
It's sooo surprising that you've got that daintiness.,Emilia
"...You seem down, Subaru.",Emilia
"I, guess. Not trying to be though.",Subaru
"Not really, that's a lie. If you were the usual Subaru, you'd be more... zany?",Emilia
Who says zany any more?,Subaru

"It's... this's my problem. I can't pull anything that'd put a burden on you, Emilia.",Subaru

"Ah, auh?",Subaru
"Take it slow. Quietly now. Take it slowly, listen to the sound of my heart.",Emilia
—Mm.,Subaru
Calmed down?,Emilia

I'm sorry for flipping out. I didn't even want to cause you problems like that.,Subaru
I don't think they're problems at all.,Emilia

Huh?,Emilia

...Subaru.,Emilia
Yeah.,Subaru
"I'm happy you feel this way. I'm truly happy. —But, I can't accept your kindness.",Emilia
—Wha?,Subaru
"N-No... about this, one-way coercion!?",Subaru
...Chances of winning really do feel slim.,Emilia
Au...,Subaru
"Say, Subaru. —Why are you trying to help me?",Emilia

I want to help you because I like you. —Because I love all of you.,Subaru

"Shit, that ain't quite it. Can't fuckin' say it right... oi, fuck're you laughin' at?",Garfiel
"Khah, hahahh...",Subaru
"Hah hahaha! I'm refreshed! Really, that's what I look like?",Subaru
Well y'do! Hell's so funny...,Garfiel

Eh?,Garfiel

—!,Subaru
...Otto?,Subaru
"Yes, hello, good morning to you. You're correct, it's me.",Otto
...Spit it out.,Garfiel
Just don't pull anythin' funny.,Garfiel

"Well, what...",Subaru
—,Subaru
"Well, what do I do? ...You said you had an idea.",Subaru
You're saying you know what to...,Subaru
"Yes, I do know. It's all very simple.",Otto
Simple...,Subaru
Do you want to know it?,Otto
"Well then, you must prepare.",Otto
P-prepare?,Subaru
"Yes. First take a long, deep breath...",Otto
—!?,Subaru
"Do not dare wear pretensions when among friends, Natsuki Subaru.",Otto

"So, here you see,",Otto
"But you see, that's where you stop.",Otto

—Hah.,Subaru
Is there something so funny?,Otto
"...But, Natsuki-san, I don't recollect you ever relying on me yet.",Otto
—,Subaru
"No, wrong.",Subaru
—,Otto
...Please try saying it.,Otto
—Whuh?,Subaru
"No, but, that...",Subaru
There... that! I told you to stop with that pretension!,Otto
"But even, saying that... I! I don't, for making you believe this mishmash...",Subaru
"You might, not be able to believe all this, but...",Subaru
Natsuki-san...,Otto
"There's no way I can pretend I didn't hear this and run away now, is there?",Otto
Wha—ahhuh!?,Subaru
After all!,Otto
—,Otto
Natsuki-san.,Otto
"...Can tell if someone's trustworthy by looking in their eyes, or something?",Subaru
Hey...,Subaru
"And so this is a first, Natsuki-san.",Otto
—Huh?,Subaru
—Roswaal!,Subaru
"—Let's make a bet. Between you and me, with a wish as the chip.",Subaru
—A bet?,Roswaal
"Yeah, a bet. You and me, staking a wish... a real one-shot make-or-break.",Subaru
—,Roswaal
Barusu—,Ram
And I'm gonna be doing it no matter what anyone says!,Subaru
—Hrm.,Roswaal
"...An intriguing statement. My coming selves, hm.",Roswaal
"Ram. Stand down. ...No, raaaaaaather, could you excuse yourself outside for a moment?",Roswaal
"...Yes, but, Roswaal-sama.",Ram
—I request you might abstain from anything that may encumber you.,Ram
—There'll be no concessions should anything happen to Roswaal-sama.,Ram
Rather you worry more about him pulling something in his self-destructive fit.,Subaru
Seriously though what a vicious world...,Subaru
Still at my absolute limit though. ...Just doing everything I can.,Subaru
"Relying on friends, relying on ties, relying on feelings... not gonna work out, huh?",Subaru
Wooooon't work at all.,Roswaal
"Really. —Well then, all we can do now is challenge each other.",Subaru
"As said, let's make a bet. The chip is a wish, the table is a one-round limit.",Subaru
Let's listen toooooooo what there is to hear.,Roswaal
A limit?,Roswaal
Yeah.,Subaru
—You're dismissing the privileges of your ability to redo?,Roswaal
That's heresy against those who'd cry for me. I'm not doing that any more.,Subaru
"So, a guarantee.",Subaru
Roswaal.,Subaru
Do you think I'd do that?,Subaru
—,Roswaal
"If you do, then... this talk isn't going to happen. That's all.",Subaru
"No, nooooo,",Roswaal
Let's heeeeeeeear the rest of it. I can decide at the end.,Roswaal
"But whatever, Roswaal. It's not like I want us to always be as enemies.",Subaru
—Hn?,Roswaal
"That's the ultimate compromise you're looking for... I see, then.",Roswaal
"Yeah, does.",Subaru
"First condition. —I make Garfiel an ally, and bring him outside.",Subaru
—,Roswaal
—The second?,Roswaal
That is impossible!,Roswaal
Won't know that until I try it.,Subaru
Well isn't that some fucking spirited anger.,Subaru
What?,Roswaal
"Roswaal, looks like you don't get it.",Subaru
"You're who said it, Roswaal.",Subaru
—,Roswaal
—Contract.,Roswaal
—,Subaru
"It doesn't appear that you're regarding this lightly... but, very well.",Roswaal
"Au, hauhh—",Subaru
Is that the end?,Subaru
That is the end. ...There's no rescinding it now.,Roswaal
—The snowfall in five days is happening again.,Subaru
"And with that, time is precious. I'm off getting started now.",Subaru
Subaru-kun.,Roswaal
The mansion is the same day. —I'll be praying for your good fight.,Roswaal
—,Roswaal
"Roswaal, it's throwing your vibe off so put the clown makeup back on.",Subaru
"Hrm, actually... this would be the first time I've spoken to you without cosmetics.",Roswaal
"In this universe, yeah.",Subaru
"So, did you successfully manage to have a contract tied?",Otto
"You say that, but... you entirely believed a contract would happen, yeah?",Subaru
"Indeed, I did.",Otto
"Anyway, so that's how my side went, how'd you go?",Subaru
"—It's an enough's enough, we need to seriously face each other.",Subaru
"—Y'know, you're...",Subaru
"Now, getting to the other one,",Otto
What would your ideas be for Garfiel?,Otto
The missing portions are...?,Otto
"Right, time to get started then. I'll be off trying Lewes-san, so...",Subaru
"How high. ...Although, not that I can refute it.",Otto
"We will, and while also for the sake of my dazzling future, let's all hope we do it well.",Otto
You said it.,Subaru
"Lewes-san, are you here? I have something I wanna talk about.",Subaru
No mice or bugs living here perhaps could maybe mean the air is polluted like crazy?,Subaru
"Now, Lil' Su. That yer here on purpose means... yer already know about what I am.",Lewes
"A part, how much?",Subaru
Lil' Su?,Lewes
Lil' Su...,Lewes
...Is that all?,Subaru
"So,",Lewes
"Well yeah. Right, how to explain...",Subaru
Putting it simply... it's about how to deal with SANCTUARY after the barrier's gone.,Subaru
"How to deal with SANCTUARY, after the barrier's gone.",Lewes
"Split of opinion? No, there shouldn't be anything like that.",Lewes
Wh?,Subaru
"Ue, eh... no, but...",Subaru
If there was actually never any opposition...,Subaru
—,Lewes
...Yer talking about Lil' Gar.,Lewes
That he dersen't want to go outside ers probably because erv our weakness...,Lewes
"Weakness, meaning?",Subaru
—,Subaru
"No, it's not that simple.",Subaru
"If we're just looking for grounds for compromise, this still isn't it... but, it's weird.",Subaru
Lil' Su?,Lewes
"Right, then... there's only one solution.",Subaru
—?,Lewes
"Roswaal, Ram, Lewes-san, potentially a yet-unseen malevolence...",Subaru
"So just for reference Lewes-san, could I ask you something?",Subaru
"Hn, what is it?",Lewes
—Do you know the contents of the TRIAL Garfiel took in the tomb?,Subaru
"...Nope, I don't. I'm sorry, but that's nert something within my knowledge.",Lewes
"Right,",Subaru
—,Lewes
Silence in this situation only means 'yes'.,Subaru
...When does the Lewes-san who knows about the TRIAL next show up?,Subaru
—,Lewes
Thing is meeting Theta and Sigma will have to be at least two days from now...,Subaru
—hk,Emilia
—?,Emilia
—,Emilia
—,Emilia
"Au, e.. ah, suhba, rhu?",Emilia
"Subaru, why are... you here?",Emilia
"Not that, I mean... um...",Emilia
"...Ah, I'm sorry. It worried you, didn't it?",Emilia
—,Emilia
"...Right, then I won't push you say it.",Subaru
"Couldn't possibly—is not how surprising a thing it'd be, to my thoughts.",Subaru
"It's fine. Anyway, come on tell me why you came here. And huuuuuurrryyyyyy",Emilia
—,Emilia
...wouldn't really be a refresher at all actually.,Subaru
It's because of this stuff that I'm just so...,Subaru
Emilia.,Subaru
—Mm.,Emilia
Do you feel like talking with me about what you saw in the TRIAL?,Subaru
The tomb's TRIAL shows you the past... that's what I've heard from everybody.,Subaru
—hk,Emilia
—,Emilia
"But, still.",Subaru
—,Emilia
—,Emilia
...But?,Emilia
—,Emilia
—hk,Emilia
Subaru...,Emilia
—,Subaru
"Subaru, is your belief in me...",Emilia
"...Tell me what you want to ask, Subaru.",Emilia
...,Subaru
...Are you okay with this?,Subaru
—Mm. I think that this is another one of my TRIALS.,Emilia
"Anyway, this might wind up being a long talk, so how about we sit?",Subaru
...We should.,Emilia
"The... the past I saw, was... probably, a memory from before my sleep.",Emilia
—? Before your sleep?,Subaru
Hold on. What does 'before my sleep' mean? It's not like going to sleep normally at night.,Subaru
"Inside ice... Emilia, what?",Subaru
"Please answer, Emilia. What does 'inside ice, inside a giant tree' mean?",Subaru
...Exactly what it sounds like.,Emilia
—,Subaru
—It made me sooo happy.,Emilia
"Green's... no actually, who's everybody?",Subaru
Everybody's everybody. Who I lived with in the forest's community... all the elves.,Emilia
"The elves... then, your family was there too? Your mom and dad... maybe siblings, too.",Subaru
—,Emilia
I'm sor... I didn't mean...,Subaru
"...When you say, was nobody. Do you mean your parents were...?",Subaru
—,Subaru
—Wha!?,Subaru
...Hold up a second.,Subaru
"Mm. I was sooo surprised too, when I started studies at the mansion and learned it.",Emilia
"—No, I don't.",Emilia
"The word 'little's come up a few times now, but around how old were you exactly?",Subaru
"...I think probably, I was seven.",Emilia
"Seven... It's safe to count elf years the same way as humans, right?",Subaru
"...Subaru, what's wrong? Was there something funny I...",Emilia
"Nope, nope. Just thinking that man you and me do have an age gap.",Subaru
"We do,",Emilia
"No,",Emilia
"This ice... right, so it had that drawback.",Subaru
"So hey, Emilia... you just said you slept for almost 100 years, right?",Subaru
"I did, yes...?",Emilia
"And you were about seven before your sleep, right?",Subaru
"I was. Subaru, what are...",Emilia
Emilia. How much time's passed since Puck woke you up?,Subaru
"...Maybe, six or seven years... I think.",Emilia
—,Subaru
"Real, physical, mental age... none are synced up...",Subaru
Fourteen... she's no different from Felt...,Subaru
—Wrong.,Emilia
I told you that you're wrong!,Emilia
"What I... saw in the TRIAL, wasn't that. I didn't see that. ...What I, saw was...",Emilia
E-Ehmil...,Subaru
—Witch's Spawn.,Emilia
—,Subaru
—,Subaru
I wanted to free everyone from the ice... and apologize.,Emilia
"If you had Puck, could you?",Subaru
—,Emilia
"M-mm... yes, but...",Emilia
"That's... mm, it's...",Emilia
"—What do you think, Subaru?",Emilia
"Emilia, you said that you want to melt the ice and thank everyone.",Subaru
Mm.,Emilia
Why do you think like that?,Subaru
"—Subaru, if I said awful things about you right now, would you stop trying to help me?",Emilia
—,Subaru
—Subaru?,Emilia
"Nothing, just thinking. That you're exactly, entirely right, that is.",Subaru
—,Subaru
—Subaru?,Emilia
—,Subaru
"But, that's...",Subaru
"Like I could accept that... begging you, Echidna.",Subaru
"Subaru, what's wrong? Did I say something strange again?",Emilia
I had Puck help me for it so many times... but I couldn't melt the ice.,Emilia
"When you say couldn't melt the ice, do you mean a mental problem? Or a physical one...",Subaru
"A physical problem, maybe.",Emilia
Offer?,Subaru
Auh...,Emilia
Roswaal... promised me.,Emilia
—,Subaru
...You believed him?,Subaru
"...Contempting me, right?",Emilia
What I said at the hall for the Selection...,Emilia
That you wanted to be viewed as equal. I don't think those words were a lie.,Subaru
"Ah... um, about yesterday...",Emilia
"It's, just when I relax suddenly I'm...",Emilia
That 'won't do anything' is sort of bothering me sooo much...,Emilia
Au...,Emilia
"Don't worry, get to sleep.",Subaru
...Is it okay for me to be spoiled like this?,Emilia
—Hand.,Emilia
Hm?,Subaru
"Oho, now leave that right to me.",Subaru
"...Really, hope you can have a good dream.",Subaru
But anyway... learned lots of stuff.,Subaru
—,Subaru
"But, thinking of the situation... this is all I can imagine.",Subaru
—You're not really damn sleeping at all.,Subaru
Haah...,Subaru
"Well then,",Subaru
...The TRIAL.,Emilia
"I like you. So, I want to be your strength.",Subaru
"After all, if I don't...",Emilia
—,Emilia
"And in the end, nothing progressed at all... I'm useless...",Emilia
Puck...,Emilia
...I'm so stupid.,Emilia
—Mhm.,Emilia
...huh?,Emilia
"Wh... weh, wha? Wait... what's, what?",Emilia
"N-no... no, don't... wait, please hold on... come on, Puck, hold on...",Emilia
"If this keeps going, then Puck will...!",Emilia
—!,Emilia
—a,Emilia
"Come, on... Puck, you're... just kidding, right?",Emilia
...iar.,Emilia
"Puck, you... Dad, YOU LIAR!!",Emilia
Barusu. Are the preparations proceeding along for your nefarious plot?,Ram
"...Pretty harsh opinion there, huh.",Subaru
It's a frank and objective opinion. Do keep that in mind as a reference.,Ram
Barusu. —Are you truly putting your hopes in her?,Ram
...,Subaru
...You know this much?,Subaru
"But I'm still putting my hopes in her, and I do believe in her.",Subaru
...Your expression is sunny. How on earth is it that you can make such a blithe judgement?,Ram
And how exactly does this connect to believing in Emilia-sama?,Ram
Because I love her.,Subaru
—,Ram
Nope.,Subaru
It does not dissatisfy you to be a tool?,Ram
—,Ram
I actually think it's you who's come up with rationalizations.,Subaru
—Why do you believe so?,Ram
"Well, yeah. Go on and do what you want. —But, well.",Subaru
I'm not devoting myself to Emilia while expecting nothing in return.,Subaru
—,Ram
"The gospel's writ's diverged already. —In this world, Roswaal's already free.",Subaru
"Tomorrow's my big day. Day after as a spare. ...Either way, cutting it close.",Subaru
That I can't give up on this one single future means now's just the exact same thing.,Subaru
Tonight's probably gonna be a bust.,Subaru
"And so I'm expecting some things from this conversation, Lewes-san.",Subaru
But that said...,Lewes
"Choosing this place fer our meeting... Yer can be pretty unkind, Lil' Su.",Lewes
"Ders sound likely, that.",Lewes
Definitely.,Lewes
Honestly for my mental state going on gossiping with a cute girl's really not that bad.,Subaru
Flirt. I got jerst a smidge ter many years on me ter be called a girl.,Lewes
Sig... what?,Lewes
...,Lewes
"—Ner, just use Sigma. Or no, do use Sigma.",Lewes
"Now,",Lewes
...,Lewes
"My stars Lil' Su, just how much der yer know?",Lewes
...,Subaru
—,Subaru
—,Subaru
I learned it from Echidna. In the tomb.,Subaru
Well then...,Subaru
"...In short, this means?",Subaru
Ah...,Subaru
"The Lewes-san who went inside, and the Lewes-san who came outside were different...",Subaru
"Fragments, of the past Garfiel saw...",Subaru
"A, goodbye.",Subaru
...,Subaru
"Maybe he hates his mother? Who left him behind, went to the outside, his mother.",Subaru
Sigma-san...,Subaru
So not to forget...,Subaru
"You look terrible, Natsuki-san. Do you realise that?",Otto
"Anyway,",Subaru
Calling the joking around as over about here... how're things actually looking?,Subaru
"You amazing guy, you're my only hope, super duper you can do it.",Subaru
"Some overwhelmingly blank encouragements, those! I could feel the air going leaden!",Otto
You're cutting down your sleeping hours for me? You're so hardworking I'm speechless.,Subaru
Nnghaah! A can of worms!,Otto
"Now,",Otto
A-are we going to be all right. There isn't any time left...,Otto
"I'll go see her one more time, after this.",Subaru
"So everything is still on the tightrope, then...",Otto
"—And, we're here. I'll be getting you in on the conversation too, this time.",Subaru
Absolutely nothing about that is reassuring at all!,Otto
"Sorry... or actually, what the heck, you're here? Emilia's alone?",Subaru
I cannot be the one present at her side when she awakes. Do you not understand even that?,Ram
"If that wasn't you attempting to provoke her, that exchange would've been rather terrible.",Otto
"...Yeah I know. I was really wondering too, while I was saying it.",Subaru
"If you knew, then that secures my impression of you secretly having a rather unkind side.",Otto
"Roswaal, it's me. Okay to come in?",Subaru
"Oooohoh, you're here. Dooooo come in, dooooo come in.",Roswaal
"Ah, so that's what it was.",Subaru
"Coming to greet us in perfect makeup means you got all dressed up on us, gonna blush.",Subaru
"Right, yeah actually I did say that.",Subaru
Or actually you could just be saying things to say them.,Subaru
Would it have been better for you that I remained wiiiiiiiiiiithout motivation?,Roswaal
"Promising words. ...If you're capable of it, dooooooooo attempt it.",Roswaal
"Regardless,",Roswaal
I have not even a fraction of a clue of what you are talking about!!,Otto
—,Subaru
Beatrice is...,Subaru
"Reason stands to that, would perhaps beeeeeeee the case here.",Roswaal
—,Roswaal
"I don't remember saying that, and what on earth is kumadori!!",Otto
"You're open to criticise me, but I have nothing to say about it.",Otto
"Noooooooow then,",Roswaal
Tasteless hobby there.,Subaru
—,Subaru
"...Yeah, I'm never going to be you, Roswaal.",Subaru
"Really. ...That is truly a regret, Subaru-kun.",Roswaal
"Let us return the conversation to the central topic. Would this be acceptable, Margrave?",Otto
Passive supervision... I'd say I lack memory of making any such commitment.,Roswaal
Hum.,Roswaal
"I humble myself with your praise... actually, is it correct to consider that praise?",Otto
That... thank you.,Otto
"Once again you talk larger than you are, ordering me tooooooo make promises.",Roswaal
—,Roswaal
"Iiiiiiiiiii see. Subaru-kun, you're blessed wiiiiiiiiiith great friends.",Roswaal
"Nothing doing then. —It's four hundred years late, but we're gonna be doing it.",Subaru
—,Roswaal
"Roswaal! Safe to call that attitude from before agreement, right!",Subaru
"Incidentally, Subaru-kun.",Roswaal
—Hm?,Subaru
I happened to have heard that the Great Spirit has split froooooom Emilia-sama's side.,Roswaal
Yeah.,Subaru
"That said, my head does feel leaden. But, I'm wondering what would...",Subaru
There's something of a sliiiiiiiiiight mystery here.,Roswaal
—,Subaru
"Noooooooo, there's enough. —Those words were all I wanted to hear.",Roswaal
"...Really? Going from your plans, wouldn't this be a good turn for...",Subaru
Ah...,Subaru
"Roswaal, I've kinda been thinking this for ages now...",Subaru
Hm? Whaaaaaaat is it?,Roswaal
"It's about your perfected gospel, and its failings.",Subaru
—,Roswaal
"Continue, Subaru-kun. About these, failings of the gospel... thaaaaat you mentioned.",Roswaal
Why don't we hear it.,Roswaal
—,Roswaal
"For the most part, eeeeeeeeexactly right. Now, the defect?",Roswaal
We really are both clowns.,Subaru
—Hm.,Roswaal
Prophecies that don't occur unless prophesied—what exactly is prophetical about this?,Subaru
—,Roswaal
—,Roswaal
—,Roswaal
"This is just absence of thought, Roswaal.",Subaru
Yeah. Actually I had thought of that rebuttal. —And so I prepared my rebuttal as well.,Subaru
"Natsuki-san, any further would be...",Otto
"—You're here, Barusu.",Ram
"Yeah, I'm here. Sorry for making you deal with this for ages.",Subaru
"We're done talking to Roswaal. I'll watch Emilia, so you're okay to go.",Subaru
...,Subaru
What do you think?,Subaru
—,Ram
"If you are attempting to use that to persuade me, how truly shallow, Barusu.",Ram
...,Subaru
Besides—my end has already been fully entrusted elsewhere.,Ram
I'm charging Emilia-sama to you. I'll visit again in the morning to wait upon her.,Ram
"R-right.. got it. Um, what did you mean just...",Subaru
"Now, what could I?",Ram
"...rhu,",Emilia
—Hm?,Subaru
"You're, up... Emilia, are you alright?",Subaru
—Subaru.,Emilia
It's fine.,Emilia
...Emilia?,Subaru
It's fine. I'm okay. ...Stay here.,Emilia
Do you know what's happened?,Subaru
"No one! Is going to fault you for that. But anyway, the problem is...",Subaru
"Don't worry, Subaru.",Emilia
"e, ue?",Subaru
I haven't... forgotten that Puck's gone. I remember it. I'm not going to forget it and run.,Emilia
"Aren't, you?",Subaru
Mm...,Emilia
"I'm sorry, Subaru. I showed you so many bad parts of me. ...I worried you sooo much.",Emilia
—There were so many. Things to think about. They happened. In the dream.,Emilia
"I'm sure I'll be okay tomorrow. I want to believe that. ...Subaru, please.",Emilia
"...au, mmhm.",Subaru
"Hold my hand. Can you please say here until morning? If you do, then I'll definitely...",Emilia
"If that's all you want, no problem at all. But, Emilia...",Subaru
—,Subaru
Stay like this until morning—Subaru.,Emilia
"All right. —I will, Emilia.",Subaru
Mm... thank you.,Emilia
...I trust you.,Emilia
How proceeded your conversation with Barusu?,Ram
"...If he is interfering, would you like me to do something about it?",Ram
"Without problems. I have ferried it exactly as you desired, Roswaal-sama.",Ram
"I see. I had been hoping for the timing to align. …Now, just what will happen?",Roswaal
—,Ram
"Now, I wonder what will come out of this.",Roswaal
—hk,Emilia
—Nhaa!,Emilia
—a,Emilia
—!,Emilia
—u,Emilia
—!,Emilia
—,Emilia
—,Emilia
Barusu. —Where has Emilia-sama gone?,Ram
—Huh?,Subaru
Emilia... what?,Subaru
"So I left, and was thinking to leave the rest to you...",Subaru
—,Subaru
"Could she've stepped outside a second for nature's call, or...?",Subaru
"That wasn't what I... but, if that wasn't it, then...",Subaru
You truly do not understand?,Ram
"—Emilia ran away, is what you're saying?",Subaru
...It's not entirely impossible.,Subaru
Emilia...,Subaru
That's my and Puck's responsibility...,Subaru
"Accepting that Emilia-sama has fled and is in hiding... Barusu, ideas?",Ram
"...Don't really want to think about it, though.",Subaru
If we go asking around and still can't find her...,Subaru
We'll need to expend all the effort we can to comb the forest.,Ram
...That's not gonna be finished in just one or two days.,Subaru
"You're seriously overestimating me here, Puck...",Subaru
...I wonder if this is also connected to the contract with the Great Spirit severing.,Ram
—,Subaru
—Natsuki-san!,Otto
"So, good news and bad news... which would you like?",Otto
"Don't like that they're a pair but nothing to do about that... okay, good news first.",Subaru
"—Right. Sorry. Really, I should've been the one talking to them and getting them to help.",Subaru
And so what's the bad news?,Subaru
"If we can, it'd be more ideal to deal with him after negotiating with Lewes Theta...",Subaru
That's the thing.,Otto
...So yer fuckin' came.,Garfiel
Yer slow. How long're thinkin' t'keep people fuckin' waitin'.,Garfiel
"I-I was running fast as I could... But anyway, what's this about Lewes-san being gone?",Subaru
Can't yer goddamn see 'swhat it is?,Garfiel
If I don't find Theta-san before today's over...,Subaru
Theeter?,Garfiel
—,Subaru
"Lib-Lib's going to be swindled forever, like that...",Subaru
"Hey, Garfiel. If you felt like it, couldn't you just summon Lewes-san?",Subaru
—hk!!,Garfiel
Fuckin' saying this bullshit so fuckin' cheerily...,Garfiel
—,Subaru
...Garfiel.,Subaru
—Tch.,Garfiel
Sure's nice of you to decide that I'm behind this.,Subaru
—,Subaru
"I don't remember ever seeing Emilia and Lewes-san being close, but...",Subaru
All of it's just way too late...,Subaru
"...Natsuki-san, how brambled does the path need to be before you're satisfied?",Otto
...,Subaru
...If you keep looking blatantly relieved like that it's truly going to be problematic.,Otto
—? What?,Subaru
Anyway!,Otto
"...Although, Emilia-sama may have done exactly that.",Otto
Turning tail and running from her problems isn't the kind of girl Emilia...,Subaru
...What're you getting at. Well yes I mean Emilia is so beautiful my eyes could explode.,Subaru
"That I will frankly agree with, but I'm sure you understand that that wasn't what I meant.",Otto
"Listening, now?",Otto
—,Subaru
"No but, when it's Emilia...",Subaru
"...That's. It's that, about Emilia, I would never...",Subaru
—,Subaru
"...Stubborn, aren't you.",Otto
...Sorry. I know there's heaps of things I have to talk about with you more properly.,Subaru
"We're friends, I'll overlook it. —Now, what do we do?",Otto
...In sum?,Otto
"—We're looking for Lewes-san. We find her before Garfiel, and hear her story.",Subaru
"...But I like your eyes, Mother Fortuna.",Emilia
Hmp... so boring.,Emilia
What could everybody be doing...,Emilia
Wanna go outside.,Emilia
—?,Emilia
—,Emilia
—,Emilia
—a,Emilia
—,Emilia
We're laying them on you as well.,Fortuna
"...Yes, you're right.",Fortuna
Don't say such this a place. We love the forest.,Fortuna
...,Fortuna
—hk,Emilia
...,Fortuna
"Always, thank you. ...I'm sorry, Juice.",Fortuna
—!,Emilia
"What do I do, whatdoIdowhatdoIdowhatdoIdo",Emilia
If I can at least hide the grazes...,Emilia
"—a, ah.",Emilia
—,Emilia
With this...!,Emilia
—Emilia? Are you up?,Fortuna
Emilia? You're sleeping?,Fortuna
"I-I'm up! I'm awake, Mother Fortuna. But, it's...",Emilia
"What, so you were up. I'm sorry for making you wait so...",Fortuna
...What is this? It reeks of ink.,Fortuna
Ermm... I'm sorry. I spilled my drawing ink lots... lots got on my clothes.,Emilia
"Oh, geez.",Fortuna
"Um, Mother Fortuna... I...",Emilia
Mother?,Emilia
...Cheeky.,Fortuna
Emilia.,Fortuna
...mm.,Emilia
—I love you.,Fortuna
"Mother, Fortuna...",Emilia
"ue... heu, hk...",Emilia
"It's... my fault. I'm a bad girl. I can't even follow instructions, and so... everybody...",Emilia
I...,Emilia
—,Emilia
"—Haaah, haahh, haaaa...",Subaru
"Are you alright, Natsuki-san? I truly have to say, you're excessively quick to tire.",Otto
—,Subaru
Emilia's...,Subaru
Feels like that'd mean conceding something to Roswaal though.,Subaru
—,Subaru
"She's running, because she wants to be chased... maybe?",Subaru
"No, surely you run because you wouldn't want to be caught. What are you talking about?",Otto
You've lost your confidence about it.,Otto
What's your take on why Lewes-san's disappeared?,Subaru
—You mean Garfiel.,Otto
Meaning there's two conceivable possibilities.,Subaru
"The chance she knew we'd search like this, and's waiting to be found... maybe.",Subaru
We should search somewhere related to Lewes-san.,Subaru
"...Otto, I think I got it.",Subaru
T-truly? From just this minute conversation? You're certain you're not misapprehending?,Otto
"We're about to have an important talk, so could you wait here for just a second?",Fortuna
"Yes, Mother Fortuna.",Emilia
...Emilia.,Fortuna
Whaaaat?,Emilia
—Nevermind. It's nothing.,Fortuna
It's safe to come out now.,Emilia
"Fairies, thank you for today again.",Emilia
—,Emilia
She definitely was sooo suspicious. But it's all ok now. Hehem.,Emilia
Okay. Say it's about time to head out today.,Emilia
What'll I do today?,Emilia
Gotta play it hands off 'till the fires cool down.,Emilia
Hokay...,Emilia
...Hrm.,Emilia
"—Hup, hup.",Emilia
...Hmp.,Emilia
"Hhrmph, dumb Juice.",Emilia
"No changes. Same as always, it's a sturdy thing.",Fortuna
"Sorry for the wait, Emilia. Were you a good girl today?",Fortuna
"Ueh... I-I was a good girl. I was. Mm, yes, I was very good.",Emilia
"—Well, then it's all fine.",Fortuna
"—Please do it, okay?",Emilia
So I'm the first guest to arrive?,Subaru
"That's right. Yer the first, Lil' Su. Hope yer don't mind yer tea being brewed strong.",Lewes
"Either way doesn't matter. Say it's strong or say it's weak, leaf flavour's still leaf flavour.",Subaru
"I couldn't even get used to Rem's tea... my body just doesn't accept this stuff, seriously.",Subaru
"Theta-san, I'm safe to think you're one of the Lewes-sans who's been in the tomb, yeah?",Subaru
—Right.,Subaru
—,Lewes
"You're, not wrong, I suppose...",Beatrice
"Auh... Y-Yes, I, do. Please forgive me. I-I, was very rude, and...",Lewes
"True in fact, Mother. Betty didn't do anything wrong at...",Beatrice
"Ueh, mhu...",Beatrice
"...I don't like Juice very much, I suppose.",Beatrice
"It's not 'something like', I am exactly your daughter, in fact.",Beatrice
"U-Understood. Please entrust this to me, Echidna-sama.",Lewes
"...Whatever, I'm fine being alone, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Wuah, auah, I am so sorry,",Lewes
"Surely that's not... I am undeserving, Mathers-sama.",Lewes
"Ermm, um... I sort of think, it's really coincidence that Beatrice-sama and I talk so often...",Lewes
"You're saying it's coincidence because that's what Beatrice calls it, yes?",Roswaal
I hope the time will eventually come where you all would understand that too.,Roswaal
"Ah! Teacher! I heard you were present, and came soaring in!",Roswaal
"What're you standing around doing nothing for, I suppose?",Beatrice
Ah... Beatrice-sama.,Lewes
"Going on with your staring, just rude as always, in fact.",Beatrice
P-Please forgive me. I apologize for my impoliteness.,Lewes
R-right. That is what I shall do. Please excuse me.,Lewes
Beatrice-sama?,Lewes
"It's nothing, I suppose. Just killing time, in fact.",Beatrice
Beatrice-sama. Would it interest you to help me fold the laundry?,Lewes
...Wha?,Beatrice
Huh?,Lewes
"I'm not saying it again, in fact. Come on, get going, I suppose.",Beatrice
Would you be interested in holding some small amount of the laundry?,Lewes
"Don't get carried away, in fact. —There's no choice, so just a small amount, I suppose.",Beatrice
This is the siel?,Emilia
How come it isn't falling?,Emilia
Queer...,Emilia
But what could it be? Hm?,Emilia
"Dunno, boring. But I did find it. Claplclapclap.",Emilia
Harump. Mother Fortuna and everybody else is wrong. Juice is wrong.,Emilia
And I bet I'm the only one who knows about the siel.,Emilia
"The artiste for today feels like drawing a red sky, and a white forest. —?",Emilia
Trouble feels afoot...!,Emilia
"—Auh,",Emilia

"...Juice, are you ok?",Emilia
"Really? You were saved, even though you're crying?",Emilia
"You're happy, but crying...",Emilia

"Honestly, I can't imagine a time where Echidna was just strolling around the place.",Subaru

...Was he friendly with Beako?,Subaru
"Somehow, I'm agreed with you there.",Subaru
"My end with her was definite, and I'm seriously still trying to put hopes in her?",Subaru
—,Subaru
True reason?,Subaru
Wh?,Roswaal
"T-then, we...!",Roswaal
—,Roswaal
You mean to say that we cannot presently do it.,Lewes
Is there no kind of definitive method?,Lewes
T-Teacher...,Roswaal
"And in doing so, save SANCTUARY?",Lewes
—,Lewes
...When do we start?,Lewes
"My role, correct? I'll work to my utmost ability. ...Lewes-kun.",Roswaal
I apologize. My ability is too lacking to save my Teacher.,Roswaal

Echidna-sama instructed...,Lewes
—I understand.,Lewes
"Let's leave. Beatrice-sama, where are the preparations set?",Lewes
"Ah, please forgive me.",Lewes
"Beatrice-sama, how did you transport the crystal?",Lewes
"...? That smile you have right now is incredibly unpleasant, in fact.",Beatrice
"P-please forgive me... hk. There's simply some, gunk in my eyes...",Lewes
Beatrice-sama.,Lewes
"For a very long time, you have taken good care of me. However—now is our goodbye.",Lewes
—wha,Beatrice
"What exactly do you mean by goodbye, I suppose? You're running away?",Beatrice
...,Beatrice
Yes. Echidna-sama has stated the same thing.,Lewes
—hk!,Beatrice
There is no time. We must decide in this instant.,Lewes
"—We can evacuate everyone with Betty's Gate Crossing, in fact.",Beatrice
...,Lewes
—,Beatrice
Yes. We do understand it.,Lewes
—hk,Beatrice
The purpose of this place is to do something about the person pursuing Echidna-sama.,Lewes

"If you... if you understand that, then why?",Beatrice

I think it was... T RISTITIA and VAINGLORY used to be counted as deadly sins.,Subaru
Why you couldn't?,Subaru
I'm seriously still missing pieces for this?,Subaru
—Beatrice lost her friend at the end.,Subaru
...Have the Lewes-sans ever met Beatrice?,Subaru
—,Subaru
It's essential that I have her meet you and the others.,Subaru
"Agree with you there. There has to be some trick to it, and to Echidna's attitude.",Subaru
—,Subaru
They sure are. Got your heart wavering?,Subaru
"You're a girl, might be my dangerous allure getting you dizzy.",Subaru
That is the first time any of the Lewes-sans has ever snorted a laugh at me!,Subaru
Theta-san...,Subaru
"Not that I put on enough bravado to actually laugh it off, but yeah.",Subaru
"And so, there are no longer any Lewes-sans opposing SANCTUARY's freedom.",Subaru
I have an idea of where she is.,Subaru

—I am doing it for a friend!!,Otto
"Alright, counting on you for buying time like we planned.",Subaru
"I, see. And incidentally I'd... no, I'll refrain from asking.",Otto
"Well, though saying it's you who's leaking the info, I really can only think it's over.",Subaru
"...Yes, I will keep that option considered.",Otto

"Auuh, she's merciless, truly. ...This is exactly who Natsuki-san described.",Otto
It seems you didn't remove Garf's EARTHSOUL BLESSING.,Ram
Earthsoul... pardon?,Otto
How much disappointment are you going to show? Since I have to say that this does hurt!,Otto
"Your luck is so poor, I cannot even feel sympathetic.",Ram
"Ram-sama, surely?",Ram
Why is it that everyone has to try kicking me down to the absolute lowest stratum!?,Otto
...,Ram
Garf.,Ram
"...Goddamn swear. Really truly a merciless lady, you are.",Garfiel
"Say, Ram. Why're you teamin' with him? What's gone'n made y'do that?",Garfiel

I... I am acting in the way I believe most meaningful in regards to my wish. That's all.,Ram
Yer wish... that is?,Garfiel
"Naturally, the fulfilment of Roswaal-sama's deepest desire. —And nothing other.",Ram
"He truly is an aggravating man, that Barusu. ...Not that even I understand why that is.",Ram
Surely you'll have recovered enough to stand?,Ram
I have never seen a maid so little associated with recuperation before!,Otto
...'gain with that pissant.,Garfiel
"Worth, really does invite question. Presently Natsuki-san may lack it.",Otto
...eh?,Garfiel
But the future will be different.,Otto
—,Garfiel
"Overstatements are... per, haps not the case here.",Otto
But Barusu is a man with strangely good timing when it matters.,Ram
"Timing. A man of only good timeliness, that is what Barusu is.",Ram
"It looks like you do have some trust in Natsuki-san, Ram-san.",Otto
It's Ram-sama.,Ram
Is this truly the time to be bringing that up!?,Otto
"Somehow, it's mysterious, but this urge to do more isn't going away.",Otto
—,Garfiel
"...enough, already.",Garfiel
Thinking is just a goddamn fuckin' pain—,Garfiel
"Erm, excuse me... honestly, there isn't very much time...",Otto
"Greetings, erm... Ram-san. It sure is a nice night out.",Otto

Hello?,Otto
A man who accepts being anyone's accessory is worthless. Begone.,Ram
Unsparing!?,Otto
"Excuse me, would you mind if we talked?",Otto
That would depend on how interesting this talk of yours is.,Ram
—,Ram
"But you absolutely do remember that I'm travelling merchant, don't you!",Otto
—,Otto
Garf transformed... we've met all the requirements now.,Ram
Garf made a mistake by picking this obvious choice. —We've won this fight.,Ram
—,Otto
"That is, well... more or less, yes.",Otto
"Of course. And with that established, so, here's the final requirement.",Ram
Right.,Otto
Make Garf transform. —That is the final requirement for attaining victory.,Ram
"His sense of smell is still subdued, yes?",Ram
...,Otto
Pathetic.,Ram
Gaeuh!,Otto
"Aeg, aghu... I-I thought I, was going to die... just now, die from just the pressure!",Otto
R-Ram-san? What are you doing?,Otto
"Erm, no, that wasn't quite it... what are you doing those exercises for?",Otto
That's simple.,Ram
Whah!?,Otto
Be silent.,Ram
"Deplorable, Garf. —Who do you think it is that you're facing?",Ram

Half and half...,Emilia
"...Just, a relief?",Emilia
Hm?,Subaru
"You found me here, and all you were was relieved? ...You weren't mad?",Emilia

"My end, and your end... neither are here yet.",Subaru
G-goddamn... fuck off... don't yer dare stand. Quit standing... I...,Garfiel

"Then we'll break that blockade... right here and right now, us!",Subaru

"And now, yer...",Garfiel
"Don't... think bad of this, Garfiel. I did say we're breaking that blockade.",Subaru
There ain't nobody...,Garfiel
"O, ver!?",Garfiel
—Gaugh!?,Garfiel
"What do you think, Garfiel...",Subaru
This—is the power of numbers.,Subaru
"Had t'be, other... goddamn, ways t', say that...",Garfiel
"Okay then, it's the assemblage of everyone's feelings, a victory for bonds.",Subaru
"Haah... 's like a damn, JEWELS NEVER COME FROM THE SOLITARY QUENE...",Garfiel
Finally heard a saying that worked...,Subaru
...Roswaal.,Emilia
"If that's really what you think, then I'd want to be more relaxed, but...",Emilia
The minor spirits have been noisy and restless for a while now.,Emilia
...Hrrrrrrrrrrrm.,Roswaal
—,Emilia
"When, there were no earth dragons...?",Emilia
"Wait, Roswaal. Why are you laughing like that?",Emilia
"...You mean, you're making fun of me. I can at least understand that much.",Emilia
Roswaal... how long were you watching Subaru and Garfiel fight?,Emilia
"—How long, which is to say?",Roswaal
—,Roswaal
"Answer, Roswaal. —What were you thinking to do to Subaru?",Emilia
"Please, answer. If you don't, I...",Emilia
—hk,Emilia
"You don't want to answer my question. Then, I won't—eep",Emilia
You...,Emilia
Truly... I have noooooooo good memories with ground dragons.,Roswaal
I will simply mention this for consideration. It's because I dooooo dislike being hurt.,Roswaal
...? But everyone dislikes that.,Emilia
"...Desperate, you say. Hrm, goodness my goodness how surprising.",Roswaal
"—No. That is enough, Emilia-sama.",Roswaal
Enough... what do you mean?,Emilia
It started with me and you? What are you talking about?,Roswaal
Huh...?,Emilia
You can't just do that!,Emilia
In Subaru?,Emilia
That book's...,Emilia
History which ought to be followed... you mean like the Dragon Stone?,Emilia
—hk!,Emilia
Cruel things...,Emilia
You and Subaru are the same? What do you mean?,Emilia
It means that we impose our ideals upon the women we love.,Roswaal
—,Emilia
...That's all?,Emilia
—,Roswaal
That's all the common points you think there are between you and Subaru?,Emilia
"If that's all you were trying to say, then...",Emilia
—,Roswaal
You and Subaru are nothing alike.,Emilia
"So, Subaru, he called me a pain in the ass of a woman.",Emilia
...What?,Roswaal
—,Roswaal
That is trickery!,Roswaal
"Turning lies into wishes, by doing these things I have to do now, is what I want to do.",Emilia
—! Absurd!,Roswaal
But it feels like that isn't what you're having a problem with right now.,Emilia
—!,Roswaal
"Aaaaguh, what is happening! How is this happening to me of all people!",Roswaal
Roswaal?,Emilia
"—Ahh, I see.",Roswaal
"What are you talking about? Roswaal, what is it...",Emilia
...Acting in a way you expect. What are you expecting from me?,Emilia
"It's natural. —That you challenge the TRIAL as you please, and that results be reached.",Roswaal
"Right now, you... definitely won't tell me about them, will you.",Emilia
...,Roswaal
"Yes. —Emilia-sama, a warning.",Roswaal
Yes?,Emilia
—Got it.,Emilia
Hauhhh...,Emilia
I need to heal them. Subaru and Garfiel both hate pain.,Emilia
"When you wake up, there are really sooo many things I want to ask you.",Emilia
THE IMPERCEPTIBLE WILL OF THE GODS... We'll call it Invisible Providence...,Subaru
Oh. I'm getting a lap pillow from Emilia-tan again.,Subaru
You are. What's the count now? For me lending you my lap when you're unconscious.,Emilia
Y-you're sooo not drowsy at all... do you remember what happened before you fainted?,Emilia
Don't worry. It doesn't look that weird.,Emilia
And spoken without any malevolence!,Subaru
"Subaru, it tickles if you move around on my lap too much.",Emilia
Who says saucy any more?,Subaru
Thanks for healing me. You managed to heal without Puck?,Subaru
Your memories sealed your ability to use magic?,Subaru
Yes.,Emilia
Huh?,Subaru
"Aaah, aaah!?",Subaru
Hi-yah!,Subaru
Eewhauhg!?,Otto
I have no idea what you're even saying any more!!,Otto
"Either way, glad you're safe. If you died you'd make for an annoying visitant bedside.",Subaru
"Don't slather on too much praise, we're talking me here!",Subaru
"I am aware of that, yes!",Otto
"Ah, Emilia-sama. I apologize for excluding you. Though it's all Natsuki-san's fault.",Otto
"Mm, I was watching so I know. Don't worry.",Emilia
One of the terms for securing her cooperation would be that I do not tell you that.,Otto
Crap!,Subaru
Ow! Why am I getting hit!?,Otto
Just be quiet.,Subaru
What's this? Since when've you been such good friends?,Subaru
"Right? She's my pride and my partner, no joke. Yeah, Patrasche?",Subaru
Gahugh!?,Subaru
Would you like a translation?,Otto
"No, even I can figure this one out.",Subaru
"—It's 'don't make me worry', isn't it.",Subaru
"So what's going on with the conquered and debt-producing mountain, Garfiel?",Subaru
Garfiel's recovering and is over there. But it might be better not to interrupt.,Emilia
Interrupt?,Subaru
"Ram's looking after him right now, you see.",Emilia
"Are you awake, Garf?",Ram
Yeah... 'm up.,Garfiel
"I see. Then move. This has gone on far long enough, and my legs are numb.",Ram
Augh!,Garfiel
"Ain't nothin'... Same 's always, yer a lady who ain't got a scrap'v kindness.",Garfiel
...My amazin' self got that merit?,Garfiel
Thinkin' back... yer the one who gave me this injury.,Garfiel

...But I!!,Garfiel
Incessant snivelling!,Ram
"Uawh.. ah,",Garfiel
"What'm I meant t'do, with this, half-way situation...",Garfiel
...What?,Garfiel
"Confirm it, myself... confirm what?",Garfiel
"Whether you're capable of changing, or whether you're still a petrified, whimpering child.",Ram
...What'll I learn by going in?,Garfiel
You look resolved.,Ram
"Don't worry, Garf.",Ram
"Apologies for this when you're motivated, Emilia-sama, but Garf is entering the tomb first.",Ram
Garfiel's doing the TRIAL... seriously?,Subaru
"Most seriously of seriously. Yes, Garf?",Ram
"Are you listening, Garf? What nerve you must have, ignoring us.",Ram
I-I... wasn't thinking to do anything violent...,Emilia
"Natsuki-san, just how many butcheries have you squeaked through? It's scary.",Otto
...How'm I th'second or third?,Garfiel
Well that's where you are. Second or third.,Subaru
What are you deciding?,Emilia
"Ngh, hah...!",Garfiel
"Ah, oh...",Emilia
Jus'take it. 'S probably right fer you t'be th'one holdin' onter this thing.,Garfiel
"Thank you, Garfiel.",Emilia

—Wha!?,Garfiel
Why! Why is it ending here! It ain't reached the fundamental...,Garfiel
Auh—,Garfiel
"Mother loved both you and I, Garf.",Frederica
Our Mother left SANCTUARY for the sake of our family. Does that dissatisfy you?,Frederica
How much easier it was to be unloved.,Frederica
No!,Garfiel
—Surely I would know.,Frederica
N'so... so what!?,Garfiel
"In truth, you did remember that Mother loved you.",Frederica
...,Garfiel
It's ending now.,Frederica
What'm I... meant to do?,Garfiel
You must ask this small elder sister of yours before you can figure any answer?,Frederica
"I know it's p'thetic! But yer th'only one I can ask. C'mon, tell me... Sis, why did you...",Garfiel
"What is it that you wish to do, Garf?",Frederica
"What is it that you wish to do, Garf?",Frederica
"I want t'do, what people're looking for.",Garfiel
What which people are looking for?,Frederica
I wanna do what... what the people who need me are looking for from me.,Garfiel
Why is it that you feel this way?,Frederica
Because... they're what made me remember.,Garfiel
—That my mother loved me.,Garfiel
So what're all our plans if reneges on his promise and destroys the tomb?,Subaru

"Alright then. You keep riding off that momentum and go for the other TRIALS too, and...",Subaru
"Yes, you're right. The rest of this is my job. Can't have it be taken away.",Emilia

Huh? You're giving me advice? Thank you. I'll remember it well.,Emilia
"Uh, I need to, right... yeah.",Garfiel

...Did you just thank me?,Subaru
"U-uhh... r-right, as reasonable...",Subaru
—,Subaru
"Garfiel, your face is sooo red.",Emilia
"Captain... I'm not the one heading this group, that's Emilia.",Subaru
Accept it.,Ram

"Ah,",Ram
"You didn't know? Garf is younger than you, Barusu.",Ram
How young.,Subaru
I believe he's fourteen this year.,Ram

A middle schooler in the peak of his rebellious age... right there's a nightmare to tame...,Subaru
"You're bringing up heavy stuff out of nowhere, stop. I don't wanna hear it.",Subaru
Do you mind if I ask you for specifics?,Emilia
I know. My TRIAL is my trial. It won't help very much to ask you about it.,Emilia
—? Then what on earth're yer askin' 'bout?,Garfiel
"Can't tell whether t'say ths'thing changed, or t'say that I got it back.",Garfiel

Can yer do it?,Garfiel
I am doing it. I've decided not to fear change.,Emilia

"Inside, where we, um... you know.",Emilia
"Y-yeah... mhm, right.",Subaru
"Oh. You're thinking about the past, pretty calm, huh, Emilia-tan.",Subaru
Am I calm? I'm not sure. I might just be bluffing.,Emilia
Bet what on it?,Emilia
The right for us to go on a date.,Subaru
"Then what happens if you win, and what happens if I win?",Emilia
"I win and I can go on a date with you, you win and you can go on a date with me.",Subaru

'S crazy cool yeah.,Garfiel
"Magic... ain't what it is. 'S just a feelin', but th'vibe ain't right.",Garfiel
Ain't gonna. Hittin' someone where they can't see it 's chicken.,Garfiel
Ch-chicken he says this punk...!,Subaru
"...But still, what karma?",Subaru
"Oh, jus'thoughter somethin', Captain.",Garfiel
What's up? Or really this whole Captain thing is still throwing me off.,Subaru
"Yer'll get accustomed. Anyway, there's somethin' I gotta 'pologize for.",Garfiel
My amazin' self went in th'tomb. N' so my amazin' self went in th' TRIAL room.,Garfiel

"Right, that standpoint right there.",Subaru
Eh?,Garfiel

"Lewes-san, not in favour of  SANCTUARY's freedom, was eyeing me.",Subaru
"Yer nailed it, Captain. Nanna told me that...",Garfiel
"Yer got it figured wrong, Lil' Su. I never told Lil' Gar about...",Lewes
"Wait! Wait, freeze! Lewes-san, you just said you don't know anything about this.",Subaru
"But, it's true that I!",Garfiel

"I-I, can't open it...",Emilia
"A-and, so...",Emilia
"Which, hope?",Emilia
—ah.,Emilia
"I... promised, my... mother, I'd keep... my, promises, so... mother...",Emilia
...huh?,Emilia
Take this!!,Fortuna
...Emilia?,Fortuna
Why is Emilia...? She was meant to have escaped the...,Fortuna
—!,Fortuna
—! Emilia and I aren't blood relatives! Her adorable face is from my sister in law!,Fortuna
Don't you dare talk about my brother and sister in law!!,Fortuna
El Huma!!,Fortuna
—! Tedious talk!,Fortuna
"—aagh,",Emilia
E-Emilia!?,Fortuna
"No! Emilia, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! That wasn't what I...",Fortuna
"You've been saying so much nonsensical junk, over and over!",Fortuna
Who the hell do you think you are to demand kindness from me!? Emilia's parents...,Fortuna
—Don't be stupid.,Fortuna
"When it's the pillagers saying it, the words are empty and superficial!",Fortuna
"Oh, Emilia... Emilia, I'm sorry. Why are you... where's Arch?",Fortuna
"Arch... told me, to run to the white flowers... so, me, I ran...",Emilia
"Emilia, Emilia... you did so well to keep your promise. You're amazing. You're amazing.",Fortuna
"Mother... Mother, I, I...",Emilia
Emilia... you're my pride. My treasure.,Fortuna
All I want right now is to dump the shards of your frozen corpse off the Cascades.,Fortuna
Juice!,Fortuna
Al Huma!!,Fortuna
—mother?,Emilia

"Mother,",Emilia
"...I'm, sorry, brother...",Fortuna
"Mother,",Emilia
"I didn't... stay, by, a single thing, you... told me...",Fortuna
"I know, you'll... be angry, sister... I know you, won't, forgive me...",Fortuna
"—I forgive you, mother.",Emilia
...Mother?,Emilia
Lia.,Fortuna
You big crybaby.,Fortuna
"I love you, sooo much...",Fortuna
"Open, the siel?",Emilia
Just die.,Emilia
Just die.,Emilia
Just die.,Emilia
Just die.,Emilia
JUST DIE!,Emilia
"Just die, just die, just die, just die!!",Emilia
Hahhh! Hahhh! Hauhhh!,Emilia

"Just die, just die!",Emilia
"—Ah,",Emilia
—,Emilia
"—ther,",Emilia
"My, strength...",Emilia
...You're not insulting me like you were before?,Emilia
Thank you.,Emilia
I wonder if anyone's still alive... in this frozen forest.,Emilia
Present an answer for the TRIAL?,Emilia
—That's already been taught to me.,Emilia
Mother loved me.,Emilia
I don't regret anything.,Emilia
"No, it's a forecast for a happy future!",Emilia
"I'll shout myself hoarse as I holler my dreams, so that my Mother in the sky can hear it!",Emilia
I am happy in the world that my Mother loved!,Emilia
Exactly. Anything wrong with it?,Emilia
"My, mother... you don't mean Mother Fortuna, you know about my other mother?",Emilia
"You can say anything you want. Me, I've gotten used to your insults.",Emilia
They won't?,Emilia
"When you talk in a way that sounds like I'm not thinking, it actually strings sooo much.",Emilia
But I don't really hate you.,Emilia
"—I'm sorry, Mother.",Emilia
Mother... mother...,Emilia
...We won't be seeing each other's faces for a while.,Emilia
You really are so overprotective.,Emilia
"...Okay. Mm, everything's fine now.",Emilia
I wish for you to please not be too mad.,Emilia
I did think you'd be around... but actually seeing you makes me feel kinda defeated.,Subaru
"That's him anticipating too much. Seriously, how huge are his estimations of me?",Subaru
Ohmegah?,Garfiel
"Hell's that, Captain. That name.",Garfiel
"No, I just mean that name's way too cool f'r th'granny... ain't fair.",Garfiel
"Basically. When there's more of you, I'll give you cool names too.",Subaru
But there ain't gonna be more of me...,Garfiel
"Well yer sure got over whatever goddamn guilt yer had, Captain.",Garfiel
"Roswaal's, state?",Subaru
"Stubborn, ain't ya. 'S a good thing t'be, granny.",Garfiel
"Seriously? I said that? Nononono hold on, oh crap, belated mortification.",Subaru
That's 'cause your head's running a whole lap behind.,Subaru
"The mastermind of the nefarious plot, a face-to-face conversation with the boss clown.",Subaru
Captain...,Garfiel
"Hoooooooow domesticated you've beeeeeeeecome, Garfiel.",Roswaal
Roswaal!,Subaru
You take that back! You don't have any right to mock Garfiel's feelings!,Subaru
—!,Subaru
"Yer words ain't got a lotta punch t'em, Roswaal.",Garfiel
Because feelings never change?,Subaru
Exactly!,Roswaal
"Because you've had these feelings for a long, long time?",Subaru
"Yes, exactly!",Roswaal
"Seriously, how come, Roswaal?",Subaru
—Because that's what I believe.,Roswaal
—!,Subaru
—! Bastard...,Garfiel
Yer got it wrong! I...,Garfiel
Hrah—!,Garfiel
Ghuh...,Roswaal
Then why are you standing in this room...,Roswaal
Wha?!,Roswaal
"Impossible... you're, you're not capable of facing your past again!",Roswaal
I ain't gonna tell yer what I figured out. 'S a waste on you.,Garfiel
What!?,Roswaal
"But I will tell yer one thing, why'm sidin' with th'Captain.",Garfiel
What.,Garfiel
"...No, it's nothing. Counting on you.",Subaru
Roswaal.,Subaru
Emilia's not going to do what you want either. She's going to overcome it.,Subaru
I have never seen a woman so fucking horrendous at crying before!,Subaru
—,Roswaal
"My name is Natsuki Subaru! Knight to the silver half-elf, Emilia!",Subaru
"As if, she can..",Roswaal
"...Regardless of what anyone may do, my feelings shall not waver.",Roswaal
"I'll, make it snow...",Roswaal
Do what you want. I'm crushing all your plans and crushing them unremittingly.,Subaru
Y'damn idiot.,Garfiel
Doing that meant we lost out on the most important point...,Subaru
"I mean, that's the idea...",Subaru
But anyway... that pose was so cool!,Garfiel
It looks like you're done speaking with the Margrave. How did everything go?,Otto
Yeah. Got him to pick up the fight we put down.,Subaru
Was that what we were attempting to do here!?,Otto
Do you remember what you went there to do? This truly isn't a joke.,Otto
Leave everythin' t'my amazin' self. —I am th'goddamn strongest.,Garfiel
And so the three idiots and one clever dragon have departed by carriage for the mansion.,Ram
"I see then. ...Well, I guess they had to.",Emilia
...Is that all?,Ram
But it means they don't think I'm going to fail.,Emilia
I wonder if he really does love me. What do you think?,Emilia
"Barusu has more feelings for you than he does for anyone else, Emilia-sama.",Ram
"...Huhuhu, thank you.",Emilia
"Emilia-sama, I must apologize.",Ram
What's wrong?,Emilia
It's sooo uncommon for you to apologize.,Emilia
"I think the same. ...However, now is the first time that I bow my head to you sincerely.",Ram
And so you helped Subaru and Otto-kun?,Emilia
...You might be right.,Emilia
Why did you do that for me?,Emilia
—Because it is essential to demonstrate your own sincerity before making a request.,Ram
—,Emilia
"I ask of you, Emilia-sama. —Please save my master, Roswaal-sama.",Ram
...Save Roswaal?,Emilia
Will Roswaal be okay if that's destroyed?,Emilia
What do I have to do?,Emilia
—I ask for you to ascend to the throne.,Ram
—,Emilia
I honestly don't know how me being Ruler will save Roswaal.,Emilia
...,Ram
"And I don't think I can truly understand what your feelings are, either.",Emilia
...,Ram
But.,Emilia
This is the first time you've ever requested anything from me.,Emilia
"I'll do it, Ram. You believe in me, and I want to answer to that.",Emilia
"And that's definitely something I'll need to start, right here.",Emilia
...I gotta save Rem-san.,Petra
B-but what about you?,Petra
This is... just like the forest.,Petra
—I gotta.,Petra
"—ah,",Petra
"...au,",Petra
Big Sis Frederica!,Petra
"You naughty girl, Petra. I told you to flee... you are going to get a scolding after this.",Frederica
Y-yes m'aam!,Petra
"My large size does bother me, you realise. Likely from my father.",Frederica
Your hobbies cannot be called tasteful.,Frederica
"Frustratingly, this is not going to prove an adequate match.",Frederica
I see. I find myself rather wishing to curse whoever failed to terminate you.,Frederica
"Petra. This time, truly do leave the mansion. I shall stall her.",Frederica
"B-But, Big Sis...",Petra
How deranged.,Frederica
"Petra. She is targeting yourself, myself, and Beatrice-sama. Do you understand?",Frederica
"—Yes, m'aam.",Petra
Leave!,Frederica
Yes m'aam!,Petra
"Yes, she's my pride!",Frederica
Wh!?,Frederica
Spider!,Frederica
"But if, Beatrice-sama was here...!",Petra
"This one... not it, then this one!?",Petra
Not here... not here either... big sis!,Petra
"Big, sis...",Petra
"—Subaru,",Petra
"Subaru, Subaru... help me, Subaru,",Petra
—wha,Petra
Are you... Subaru? You're here?,Petra
"It's me, and I'm here. Everything's okay now.",Subaru
Subaru... Big Sis Frederica's fighting with a lady upstairs.,Petra
Frederica is?,Subaru
"She's dark, with a big knife... and really scary.",Petra
"A dark horrifying lady with a huge knife... yeah, I know her.",Subaru
"Please, save Big Sis Frederica! Beat that lady, Subaru!",Petra
—,Petra
And so I sent in some crazy strong reinforcements instead.,Subaru
"Have a nuisance being an incredible nuisance for the reunion, though.",Subaru
Do not be impolite.,Frederica
"Is that you, Garf?",Frederica
"Nevermind that, 'm I really safe t'be callin' yer Frederica... can't frickin' believe it... gahk!",Garfiel
Do not neglect to appropriately refer to me as your elder sister.,Frederica
No. Garf... you have truly grown large.,Frederica
Th'hell was that!?,Garfiel
"Ah, Otto-sama was also with you.",Frederica
Th'fuck!?,Garfiel
"Y'know,",Garfiel
"I did tell yer t'get th'hell out'v here, yeh?",Garfiel
Garf!,Frederica
—Fuckin' cheek!!,Garfiel
—!?,Frederica
"Get outta here, woman!!",Garfiel
The one being a moron is you!,Frederica
Dgha!?,Garfiel
Fighting in a manner which injures yourself... Grandmother would cry if she saw this.,Frederica
"Aeuh, guh... a-ain't like I don't know what th'granny'd think'v it...",Garfiel
Garf! This woman is shrouded in mystery. Take care not to slacken your guard...,Frederica
"'M sayin' I got that. But anyway. Sist... sis, d'you know a girl called Rem?",Garfiel
"...? Yes, she is in this mansion. I, erm, heard that she is Ram's younger sister.",Frederica
She look like Ram?,Garfiel
Exactly like Ram. But that is no pardon for you to use her as a replacement.,Frederica
"I ain't gonna do anythin' scummy like that. Jus'lookin' t'check. —Seriously, then.",Garfiel
"W-what are you saying? I will be fighting as well. With us together, our chances...",Frederica
...Garf?,Frederica
Wha!,Frederica
"Don't go misunderstandin' me, sis. I ain't sayin' yer a detriment.",Garfiel
...Then what are you saying?,Frederica
"'F me n' this chick get serious, this place's gonna turn into a warzone.",Garfiel
"Stop thinkin' bout pointless crap, sis.",Garfiel
Garf...,Frederica
Got it? In total there are four people in the mansion we have to save. They're all girls.,Subaru
"Sis, hrn... Ain't seen her for ten years now.",Garfiel
Apparently?,Otto
Gave them all t'granny without reading them.,Garfiel
Then the second would be Petra-chan.,Otto
Next is Rem. She's Ram's younger sister. Though you probably don't remember her.,Subaru
...You're right about that.,Subaru
S-so cool...!,Garfiel
Though...,Subaru
"I mean it's been horrifying watching this, but is this actually seriously working?",Subaru
Stop!! I'm gonna die!! I'm gonna die before you do!!,Subaru
"But anyway, y'stopped talkin' halfway, Captain.",Garfiel
Huh?,Subaru
I would like to think that that is not the reason I've failed to see her!,Otto
"The last one... Beatrice, probably, won't come out unless it's me.",Subaru
I'm taking Beatrice out of there. Dragging her out of there. I need to do it.,Subaru
"'F that's what yer say then that's what it is, Captain.",Garfiel
"Thank you, idiots.",Subaru
"He's incapable of giving an honest thanks, the idiot!",Otto
It don't make me happy to hear that from anyone 'cept Ram!!,Garfiel
It ain't over yet!,Garfiel
Yer done!!,Garfiel
Like that trick's gonna work!,Garfiel
—!?,Garfiel
—yhher prhahise ain't ghonher mhake me happy!,Garfiel
Fhuckin' stinks!!,Garfiel
"Pretty fuckin' good t'get away by losin' only an arm. Crap, m'mouth hurts.",Garfiel
...I-indeed. I shall.,Frederica
...Huh?,Frederica
—!,Frederica
Sis.,Garfiel
—I believe in you.,Frederica
Yer so unruffled that yer can overlook sis... ain't what's happenin' here.,Garfiel
"Honestly, 's just fuckin' gross. M'rippin' yer apart, manglin' yer t'shreds.",Garfiel
"...The Strongest of Shields, Garfiel Tinzel.",Garfiel
Entertainin'!!,Garfiel
—!!,Garfiel
—!,Garfiel
Y'fuck... 'm pretty sure I'm meant ter'v turned yer left arm useless.,Garfiel
"After all, yer th'same as one'v the old Witches.",Garfiel
—Yer a goddamn VAMPIRE!,Garfiel
Not fuckin' cool! Yer arm's seriously all back t'normal!?,Garfiel
Yer ain't denyin' it. So yer really are a vampire?,Garfiel
So yer on about guts so much because yer a vampire?,Garfiel
That's way fuckin' creepier.,Garfiel
"S' a big world... bit've a drag, but yer better pull it off, Captain.",Garfiel
—How come?,Beatrice
It's miserable and my heart's about a second from popping so let's cancel that topic.,Subaru
"Yup, always of my accord. So no matter how much you hate it, I'm here.",Subaru
This place is sooo nasty for spiritualists.,Emilia
Which is strange... since I can hardly sense anyone outside.,Emilia
Ram was pleading me. Have to keep focused.,Emilia
"I'm glad they believe in me, but that's not what this is about.",Emilia
"Anyway, this feeling... the TRIAL's here.",Emilia
"I saw my past. Then, the next one is...?",Emilia
—hk,Emilia
"Subaru,",Emilia
"Mother, Fortuna...",Emilia
Woah.,Emilia
"Mother, you're cute.",Emilia
—. Where did that come from? You really are half-asleep.,Fortuna
Good morning. You're all out early.,Emilia
—Right.,Emilia
Iiiii'm—heeere!,Emilia
"Ah,",Emilia
Arch! Are you okay?,Emilia
"Look, Emilia! Don't interrupt people right when they're almost done bathing!",Arch
"I'm sorry. I didn't think anyone'd be here... but I'm glad it was you, Arch.",Emilia
What're you implying!?,Arch
"I mean we're close Arch, so you'll forgive me.",Emilia
Auh...,Arch
Think damn what. Goddamn it... has no idea what I feel...,Arch
And I came here to take a bath. Can I jump in next to you?,Emilia
Nuhh...,Emilia
No nuhhs!,Arch
Wehh...,Emilia
No wehhs either!,Arch
"Arch, I'm sorry.",Emilia
"Er, um... h-how come you're being so docile suddenly?",Arch
That's something a kid'd think!,Arch
"Woo,",Emilia
Ah!,Arch
"—Pahh,",Emilia
No! Pahhs!,Arch
"This feels nice, Arch.",Emilia
Okay. I'm glad you're having fun too.,Emilia
"You really are an optimistic girl, Emilia...",Arch
Are you unwell? Is that why you're mad you fell in the water?,Emilia
"...? But Arch, you're who I'm closest with?",Emilia
Even around people you're close with! Erm... b-but just only do it around me.,Arch
Not around Mother?,Emilia
"Around Fortuna-sama, me, and that woman!",Arch
"Actually, you might be right. ...I didn't bring a change of clothes.",Emilia
"Seriously, what are you doing...",Arch
"Ahaha, I'm sorry, Arch. Thank you for lending me this.",Emilia
...Was my hair always this long?,Emilia
"auh, ah...",Emilia
"Emilia, what's wrong?",Arch
Did you see something strange in the river?,Arch
...No.,Emilia
"That's, not it.",Emilia
"Did something happen to your face? But I think it looks the same, pretty as always.",Arch
It's an adult's...,Emilia
Huh?,Arch
My face is an adult's. ...I've never even seen my face before.,Emilia
I...,Emilia
—I have to go.,Emilia
Emilia?,Arch
"Arch, I'm sorry. I'm going back to Mother Fortuna's.",Emilia
"Y-yeah... that's fine, but is everything okay with you?",Arch
I'm fine now. I'm sorry for interrupting your bath. And I'll be okay without the towel.,Emilia
Emilia!,Arch
"Right! Thank you, big bro!",Emilia
"I'm sorry, Mother. I was kinda... sooo kinda half-asleep.",Emilia
"No, it's okay. Only Arch saw.",Emilia
Mother?,Emilia
"Ah, erm, no, it's nothing. Now, come here.",Fortuna
"Mother, the house is getting all wet.",Emilia
"Come on, get going.",Fortuna
"Wagh,",Emilia
"Mother Fortuna, I'll wash the wet clothes by myself, so...",Emilia
—,Emilia
Juice.,Emilia
"Mother, you kept it a secret.",Emilia
"Huhu, now did I? I might've only forgotten about it.",Fortuna
"I don't think so. Juice's seat is there, and you're making food for three.",Emilia
Hrmp... changing the subject. And I can't cook because you won't teach me.,Emilia
"And there you go again, saying that so easily.",Fortuna
That's what I'm saying is devious.,Fortuna
"If Mother's food makes you so happy, Juice, you should just live here too.",Emilia
Wh—Emilia!,Fortuna
You're not.,Fortuna
"See, you really do get along sooo well.",Emilia
"Stop teasing us, Emilia. Juice, tell her off too.",Fortuna
"Hrrmpf. But, I think you're too late for that.",Emilia
"Wh-who is, saying...",Fortuna
"Tehena-san from across the street, Mitto-san and granny Tansei.",Emilia
Those three gossips...!,Fortuna
I think it'd be sooo great. You two should think about it too.,Emilia
A-and so... I'll leave the rest to you young'ns.,Emilia
"Seriously, Emilia, where are you leaning this?",Fortuna
"Hee, huhuhu.",Fortuna
"You were, Juice. She's my prided daughter, of course she would.",Fortuna
...Emilia?,Fortuna
"I, think there's some gunk in my eye. Gunk that's sooo big.",Emilia
That big? Are you okay?,Fortuna
"I'm okay, it's only fist-sized.",Emilia
I'm fine!,Emilia
"And they're the same colour as yours, Mother.",Emilia
You two eat breakfast. I'll be back right away.,Emilia
"It won't be good once it gets cold, so really do come back right away.",Fortuna
"Mm, right right away.",Emilia
—I love you both.,Emilia
"If I don't face it, it won't start.",Emilia
Taking me out of here...?,Beatrice
"Unwanted meddling, I suppose. Nobody asked for you to do that, in fact.",Beatrice
This isn't about anyone asking or not asking me. I'm taking you out of here. Decisively.,Subaru
"Just scram and have that foolish girl comfort you on her lap, I suppose.",Beatrice
You little... this's war! You say something like that and it's war!,Subaru
The strategy's like this 'cause I know he's way too kind.,Subaru
"Essential evacuees... you mean to say that Betty is the last, in fact.",Beatrice
"Yeah, I do.",Subaru
"Don't make me repeat myself, I suppose. I don't need your help, in fact.",Beatrice
"A fatal, flaw?",Beatrice
—hk,Beatrice
"Why does that woman know how to break Betty's GATE CROSSING, I suppose?",Beatrice
—,Subaru
Beatrice. This isn't the time for that conversa—,Subaru
"—It's Roswaal, in fact.",Beatrice
"It is written in Roswaal's gospel that I be killed, I suppose.",Beatrice
Want to tell me what that sigh was? And why the hell you look like you're agreeing!?,Subaru
"Nothing is written, in fact. Identical as ever, only blank pages, I suppose.",Beatrice
"...The same as ever, I'm the one deciding?",Beatrice
What in my life have I ever decided?,Beatrice
"Bea, trice...",Subaru
What if there's people who don't want that blank book gone?,Subaru
Then! Then what is that book doing in that place!,Subaru
—,Beatrice
And so then—,Subaru
"The book mustn't be disposed of until it reaches the SOMEONE, you're saying, I suppose.",Beatrice
—,Subaru
"—Just, enough, in fact.",Beatrice
An old friend of yours might kill you... how is that relaxing?,Subaru
"It's obvious, in fact.",Beatrice
"...What are you thinking to do, in fact?",Beatrice
—,Subaru
Stu...!,Beatrice
"O-other, possibilities...",Beatrice
Straight-out. The possibility your mom's book was wrong.,Subaru
"What, are...",Beatrice
Then I'll say it loud and clear! So that your stupid self and your stupid mother can hear it!,Subaru
—,Beatrice
It's four hundred years. Plenty long enough for at least one rebellious phase to hit.,Subaru
"—Demanding that I, Beatrice! Violate a contract! Speaking as if you know anything!",Beatrice
—Aguh!?,Subaru
—!,Beatrice
"Be silent, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Th-that is unrelenting, incorrigibly insidious of you, in fact...",Beatrice
"I-if, you... were THEY...",Beatrice
Will...,Beatrice
...you be Betty's THEY?,Beatrice
Are you stupid? —Of course I wouldn't be this weird mysterious THEY of yours.,Subaru
"Conceivably, it is laughable, I suppose.",Beatrice
"That guy... that guy... truly, what is wrong with him, I suppose!",Beatrice
"I'm exhausted, in fact...",Beatrice
"I pissed her off so much she threw me out... fuck, messed up with my word choice!",Subaru
"Anyway, can't stay here. Have to find Beako through another door and...!",Subaru
"Unfortunately, the situation outside has changed rather dramatically...",Otto
What happened? Short version please.,Subaru
"Witchbeasts did. Hordes of witchbeasts are encircling the mansion, and we cannot move.",Otto
Witchbeasts!?,Subaru
Do these guys live in the nearby forest?,Subaru
"They do, but.... the barrier should be keeping them out.",Petra
This barrier again...,Subaru
Okay. That's a relief.,Subaru
What about Frederica and Rem?,Subaru
Where are we right now? Which wing of the mansion?,Subaru
And so the possible escape routes are...,Subaru
What the hell is Garfiel doing!?,Subaru
Just one hit!?,Subaru
Stop saying this terrifying stuff!,Subaru
Take this I guess!,Subaru
"She's our pride and a good girl, moron!",Subaru
Then how about this!,Otto
She's a collector!,Subaru
—,Subaru
I'll show you something better.,Subaru
—○○○,Subaru
That ambush did not even work... those are not the reflexes of a human.,Frederica
"Frederica, my bad, thank you. And, Petra too.",Subaru
"N-no, I'm who should say sorry. But, Subaru... your eyes looked so scary, and...",Petra
Inv... what?,Petra
Big Sis Frederica...,Petra
"It must have been frightening for you, Petra. You did well to not cry.",Frederica
I have her.,Frederica
E-even so try to treat her carefully as possible okay?,Subaru
Gotta do something to solve the problems at hand.,Subaru
But it looked like it'd been pretty deep?,Subaru
Anyone'd think something was up the second you weren't split in two by Reinhardt.,Subaru
"Subaru-sama... her being present here would mean, Garf is...?",Frederica
"That's how I see it too, but in the end we don't...",Subaru
That moron!!,Subaru
"Uh, wha!?",Subaru
"Hey, Captain. Th'hell, y'were still inside?",Garfiel
"Yer don't need t'freak out, 's all good. My amazin' self killed it.",Garfiel
Pest which means?,Subaru
...What is that thing?,Otto
"From what I'm seeing, a biggish hippo.",Subaru
Bigg'ish'?,Otto
Yeah. 'Cause hippos are big anyway.,Subaru
...From the witchbeast forest.,Subaru
She's from back then!,Petra
"Roswaal's, plans!",Subaru
Like I can accept something so stupid!,Subaru
Y-you're sure not discouraged from talking. You do realise what this situation is?,Subaru
"I don't know how it works, but is it safe for me to think she's controlling the witchbeasts?",Subaru
Garfiel... can I ask you to do something crazy?,Subaru
"Try me, Captain.",Garfiel
I want you to stall Elsa and the girl simultaneously.,Subaru
—,Garfiel
No problem. Just leave it t'me. Gotten fired up now.,Garfiel
—!? S-seriously? No kidding? You can do it?,Subaru
"Garfiel. I know I already said this countless times in the carriage, but...",Subaru
I hear ya. My amazin' self got no ideas'v dyin' in this place either.,Garfiel
Now get goin'. I ain't able t'get serious 'f yer gettin' in th'way.,Garfiel
"Y-you can do it, scary-looking man.",Petra
"Witchbeasts generally just say ME EAT YOU WHOLE, so it isn't really a conversation!",Otto
Subaru-sama. I have an idea for an escape route.,Frederica
"I know, Frederica. It's probably the same place as what I'm gonna suggest. But...",Subaru
"No matter where we run they just can't make it easy for us, fuck!",Subaru
Ghaaaaaaaahgr!,Garfiel
Fuckin' fuck off!!,Garfiel
"Got yer wrist n' yer knife, haha.",Garfiel
Yer can keep yer bravado ter yerself.,Garfiel
Eh?,Garfiel
Stop treatin' me like a kid. My amazin' self's n' amazin' man.,Garfiel
"Fuck're you laughin' at, huh?",Garfiel
Th'Captain's group's funny?,Garfiel
Ha. Stupid bullshit.,Garfiel
"Are you alright, Frederica?",Subaru
"T-this time alone... I lack any margin to refute your ribbing, Natsuki-san.",Otto
"We're just, utterly... we lost because we had to split up with Garfiel...",Subaru
"With how dutiful you are, you really don't feel suited to being a merchant...",Subaru
Big Sis Frederica...,Petra
"Though yeah, we really are close to our destination.",Subaru
—,Frederica
...I'm so selfish.,Subaru
Natsuki-san.,Otto
Subaru.,Petra
Subaru-sama. I believe that we ought to choose that path nonetheless.,Frederica
"Incidentally, Subaru-sama. Where have you previously met that assailant woman?",Frederica
Yeah.,Subaru
Her personality?,Subaru
What makes you think that?,Subaru

It's sooo... sore a spot you're going for. Are you like this with everyone?,Emilia

...You're not wrong.,Emilia
But I'm going to act as if you are.,Emilia
But that's just a neglect to think! It's lame!,Emilia
It is!,Emilia
I'll think about that after I finish the TRIAL!,Emilia
You're right... I am a weak child.,Emilia
"But,",Emilia
Is being weak really so wrong?,Emilia
Mm. I was slow to reorient.,Emilia
Thank you for showing me this world.,Emilia

"But... this does mean that the second TRIAL is really over, right?",Emilia

—It's just pitch black.,Emilia
—huh?,Emilia
...I think it's inevitable that you would. But how would this be 'not the nicest of things'?,Emilia
D-discussed it!?,Emilia

You do. ...Wow.,Emilia
Y-yes?,Emilia

"Thank you, Lewes-san. Now, I know I can try sooo hard.",Emilia
"I see, I see. Well, good. ...Next one should be the last TRIAL.",Lewes
"Yes, it is. —I'm going to challenge it right away.",Emilia
I'm going.,Emilia
—That is simple.,Ram
"Delusion, yoooooooou say.",Roswaal
"I have have simply kept silent, but always thought so. As I naturally would.",Ram
—,Ram
Won't make gambles... because what came of prioritising accuracy was the gospel.,Ram
...I will not deny that.,Ram
"Do you remember? The contract that we formed, with the gospel as our intermediary?",Roswaal
Your life or death rests upon me.,Ram
That waaaaaaaaas the contract.,Roswaal
It must have been truly long and painful for you.,Roswaal
—,Ram
—?,Ram
What might you mean?,Ram

—,Ram
"Although,",Roswaal
I do understand your desire to destroy me as soon as conceivably possible.,Roswaal

—,Roswaal
Is something the matter?,Ram
That only makes it even less conceivable!,Roswaal
"I did at first. But not now. Now, I love you.",Ram
"This idiotic...! Who would, think such a cheap...!",Roswaal
—!,Roswaal
I shall never allow you to become an invalid.,Ram

"Possible, futures.",Emilia

"Worlds that end tragically for everybody. No, I'm not prepared to see those at all.",Emilia
No. That's going to make me face it.,Emilia
"If I were alone, it might.",Emilia
Is it really that funny?,Emilia
So unfair.,Emilia
Should it really be that simple?,Emilia
"You mean... once I go through that door, the TRIAL's over?",Emilia
"Erm, well I am kinda bothered. Sooo just kinda bothered.",Emilia
"Open, the door. Mm, right. And go in there... what's in there?",Emilia
"I stop the tomb's functions, and SANCTUARY's duties end. So the barrier disappears.",Emilia
"Mhm, thank you. That's how I want to go my way.",Emilia
Sekhmet-san. Can you tell Echidna something for me?,Emilia
"—Ah, gotta stop.",Emilia
I should be able to open the door.,Emilia
"Anyway, have to go in. Okay, here I go.",Emilia
...I feel like Echidna's smiling so nastily right now.,Emilia
She's beautiful...,Emilia
She looks like Echidna... but who is she?,Emilia
"Then, this thing she's entombed in... is the mechanism to turn off the barrier?",Emilia
"Seriously, who is she... maybe Echidna's mother?",Emilia
And... there's no name. But this is supposed to be Echidna's tomb.,Emilia
"Maybe this is Echidna, and the girl I saw in the dream wasn't Echidna?",Emilia
"It's Echidna's tomb, but someone else is sleeping here... might be what's happening.",Emilia
"It's amazing... so amazing, that I have no idea what it's doing...",Emilia
"There. If I cut off this flow, that will probably sever the supply.",Emilia

"—I just can't let go, can I?",Emilia
...I guess that's the end.,Emilia
"It's over... yes, it's over...",Emilia
"Teacher... is what he said, right?",Emilia
And maybe... that was you.,Emilia
—I need to talk to everyone.,Emilia

Then why!? Didn't you hear that it's going to be dangerous here?,Emilia

"That man is... Subaru is not fit to be my  THEY, in fact.",Beatrice
...Hrm.,Roswaal
That soooooooounds quiiiiiiiiiite the harsh opinion.,Roswaal
"However, you say that the one you picked, Subaru-kun, is unfit to be THEY?",Roswaal
What a... prideful thing to say.,Roswaal
"I don't dislike that forcefulness, in fact.",Beatrice
"You don't seem to understand, I suppose, Roswaal.",Beatrice
I don't?,Roswaal
—,Beatrice
Roswaal...,Beatrice
—,Beatrice
"Roswaal. What happened to your gospel, I suppose?",Beatrice
—I wonder iiiiiiiiiif I am.,Roswaal
...?,Beatrice
"We haven't spoken nearly enough,",Roswaal
"Roswaal, what are you trying to say, I suppose?",Beatrice
Teach—!?,Beatrice
"Impossible, are... you, Roswaal?",Beatrice
I've always been Roswaal?,Roswaal
"No! Not like that... you have to know what I mean, I suppose!",Beatrice
"I'm only joking. And you're correct. I'm—it's me, Beatrice. Roswaal.",Roswaal
"But, then... Roswaal, this... how!?",Beatrice
"Are you going to call me inhuman, Beatrice?",Roswaal
"Euch, huh. Hooooooooow harsh.",Roswaal
"...I, see.",Roswaal
"Roswaal. Squat down for a moment, I suppose.",Beatrice
Squat? Here?,Roswaal
"Grin and bear it, in fact.",Beatrice
—Ghah!?,Roswaal
...And I think that's your hindsight bias speaking after everything ended with no deaths.,Roswaal
Sorry. —But I don't feel that I've done anything wrong. Let me state that much.,Roswaal
"Whatever, I suppose. If you're going to apologize, do it the others, in fact.",Beatrice
Beatrice. What follows is a discussion only between you and me.,Roswaal
—,Beatrice
"—If it were possible to truly see Teacher again, would you assist me in it?",Roswaal
Well we're just leaving that to Beako.,Subaru
"Good work, Subaru... Why are flailing your arms around?",Emilia
Really?,Emilia
There's a whole mountain of Pucks. I know he'd be happy to see this.,Emilia
"Would he? I'm imagining him complaining like, 'But I thought I was prettier than that?'",Subaru
"Oh, that did sound like him. Puck, are... ah, he's sleeping right now.",Emilia
But you can't summon him like you could before.,Subaru
Gotta get a better gemstone. Something like the old green one.,Subaru
I mean that's the same case here about the only ever getting things thing.,Subaru
"By the way, Subaru... so, um.",Emilia
Mhm?,Subaru
"They're taking a long time in the tomb. ...Mhm, it sure is long.",Emilia
"E-Emilia-tan!? Your face just flashed to red, I mean are you okay!?",Subaru
"I, I'm, indeed.",Subaru
"So, um... Subaru, it's like, you said that you l... love me, right?",Emilia
"Erm, um, yes. I did say that. I love you.",Subaru
"—. Well, that, erm, makes me, sooo, sooo happy, but...",Emilia
But! I think that we really need to talk about the baby in my tummy!,Emilia
—,Subaru
Pardon me?,Subaru
"No, no, no no, no... wait, wait, wait...",Subaru
"Emilia-tan. When you say baby, you mean like an infant, right?",Subaru
"Emilia-tan... you know that babies don't come from storks or cabbage patches, right?",Subaru
But when a boy and a girl kiss that makes a baby.,Emilia
—,Subaru
"Subaru? What's wrong? Hey, Subaru!",Emilia
"Subaru, maybe, you regret kissing me...?",Emilia
Uh no actually I'm craving your infinite kisses!?,Subaru
A-are you now...,Emilia
"C-curse you, Puck!",Subaru
Personally think my amazin' self's bein' damn nice t'let yer off with just one punch.,Garfiel
"Stop bein' so passive, Captain. C'mon, have a go.",Garfiel
"...Where is this going, exactly?",Subaru
It's already enough of a dick move to beat him up after what you did!,Subaru
"It don't look like anyone agrees with yer, Captain.",Garfiel
Huh?,Subaru
"Brace yourself, Master!",Frederica
Seriously!? Everyone endorses this retaliation?,Subaru
You won't let me in on the talk if I don't hit him?,Subaru
"I ain't goin' that far. 'S just that you wanna smack the shithead 'cross the face too, yeh?",Garfiel
"Subaru, your eyes look kind of distant, are you alright? Are you still not feeling well?",Emilia
...You're right.,Emilia
...For what?,Ram
"No, I mean,",Subaru
—It won't happen again.,Roswaal
And I'd rather Beatrice not punch me a third time.,Roswaal
You're putting my hit in the same class as that? It couldn'tve been that strong.,Subaru
"...Well, it's because Garfiel and Emilia-tan put in serious work.",Subaru
"—So hey, Captain.",Garfiel
Garfiel...,Subaru
"But still, we need Roswaal.",Subaru
Captain!,Garfiel
Yer really fuckin' telling me to forgive a guy who tried to kill my family!?,Garfiel
—,Subaru
I... forgive the Master.,Frederica
...Sis!?,Garfiel
Fuck're you saying! This shithead tried to...,Garfiel
"And given that, I am still alive. Because you saved me, Garf.",Frederica
...The Master has cared for me for over a decade.,Frederica
Don't fuckin' treat debts on the same level as life! You don't know when he'll betray—,Garfiel
"Erm, I apologize for this when you're so enthusiastic, but would you mind if I interjected?",Otto
"Now just calm down, calm down.",Otto
"Eh? Fuck're yer sayin' prick. Yer fuckin' asleep? I'll put yer lights out, oi.",Garfiel
"Course, bein'?",Garfiel
Petra...,Subaru
...It does hurt toooooo hear that.,Roswaal
"We ain't gonna convince each other, Captain.",Garfiel
—Tch.,Garfiel
"Very well, accepted.",Roswaal
"N'following from that condition, two more promis... no, a CONTRACT.",Garfiel
—,Roswaal
"...Yes, of course. And the other?",Roswaal
"Easy. —You violate that, and my amazin' fangs mash your head to pieces.",Garfiel
Very well. —Let us tie the contract.,Roswaal
"...'S all I got for th'moment. You best leave it there too, miss.",Garfiel
But...,Petra
It ain't gonna make yer friends or family happy if y'tell them.,Garfiel
"Go ahead, Emilia-tan. Feel free to say anything.",Subaru
Then I'll oblige.,Emilia
Roswaal hasn't done the most important thing yet. This discussion isn't over until he does.,Emilia
Most important thing...?,Roswaal
"When you do something bad, you have to say you're sorry.",Emilia
Roswaal.,Subaru
—,Roswaal
"—Mm, that'll do.",Emilia
Whaaaaaaat an impolite face to make whiiiiiile looking at my Teacher.,Roswaal
"This is honestly your Teacher, the WITCH Echidna?",Subaru
Beatrice hit me with the eeeeeeeexact same comment.,Roswaal
Do you feel guilty at all about your descendants? ...I guess the answer's obvious.,Subaru
The quintessential stalker.,Subaru
I feel that you're imagining something rather iiiiiiiimpolite.,Roswaal
We can't use the TRIAL's systems to enter the dream again?,Subaru
"I, see...",Subaru
What do you mean?,Subaru
You're going to resurrect the dead!? That... this world has magic to bring back the dead!?,Subaru
Od Lagna?,Subaru
"The od of the world... wouldn't permit it, meaning?",Subaru
To explain that would require quick perusal of the entire history of magic to this day.,Roswaal
In three sentences.,Subaru
How harsh.,Roswaal
"That's when magic got names, and was split into the separate type affinities.",Subaru
"Kind of a spiteful lecture, since you're one of the geniuses.",Subaru
"I may have gone through unpleasant times, oooooonce or twice.",Roswaal
So what does this have to do with Od Lagna?,Subaru
And that was Od Lagna... the fountain of the world?,Subaru
Then resurrection would be one of them?,Subaru
'That celestial bunch' is an entertaining way to put it.,Roswaal
"So, your reunion with your Teacher won't enrage Od Lagna.",Subaru
...Honestly I was thinking the same.,Subaru
"Just the idea makes me shudder. Anyway, your methods for this are...?",Subaru
"Sorry, but I'm not going to tell you that now.",Roswaal
"Huh, wh, wha? What did you say?",Subaru
"I mean, yeah, but... come on!",Subaru
"I want to make this clear to you, Subaru-kun.",Roswaal
That is simple. —I will oversee you.,Roswaal
—,Subaru
Excuse me?,Subaru
What's so sagely about that. What is so clever about accepting loss!,Subaru
—hk,Subaru
...!?,Subaru
...Really taught me to be more careful when looking at contracts.,Subaru
—,Subaru
...What is it.,Subaru
—Huh?,Subaru
"But, that can't... I mean, she and Elsa are from the same group! So!",Subaru
"Someone other than myself was operating to attack the mansion, iiiiiiiiiis what it means.",Roswaal
—,Subaru
"Adversity never seems to end, and isn't there worth in resisting it?",Roswaal
Beako.,Subaru
That's a real issue. And I just told you how awesome I'd be oh hell this is pathetic.,Subaru
"Well, if you're so inclined then I'll deal with it with you, in fact.",Beatrice
"...That's your mother, there.",Subaru
"And she isn't the Echidna that you know, I suppose.",Beatrice
I wonder what happened to Lewes Meyer's crystal.,Subaru
"...I don't know, in fact.",Beatrice
"Well I can sound as pompous as I want, I'm still insignificant by myself.",Subaru
"Subaru, what are you grinning about, I suppose?",Beatrice
"It feels that I understand what you're saying, while simultaneously I don't, in fact.",Beatrice
"Well yeah,",Subaru
"...Ahm, I suppose.",Beatrice
"Subaru. —I have something important to tell you, in fact.",Beatrice
Hm?,Subaru
Flaws...,Subaru
Monopolization of your contractor?,Subaru
"...Okay, got it.",Subaru
G-good.,Beatrice
Okay. Well I'm drowning in stuff I don't know here so please just tell me anything.,Subaru
Mileage... makes you sound like a car.,Subaru
W-well sure. I can't imagine how strained I'd be if I tried doing any of that.,Subaru
Okay. ...Then how were you getting by in the mansion?,Subaru
"...I-I was taking bits from everyone there, in fact.",Beatrice
"—None, I suppose.",Beatrice
...Hm?,Subaru
So... did we just make a team of a spirit and spiritualist that can't use magic!?,Subaru
"W-well, I suppose that's one way you could put it, in fact.",Beatrice
"How else could you put it!? The hell! Are you kidding me, is this seriously happening!?",Subaru
Actually I'm really worried about where this is going now!? Are you sure we'll be okay!?,Subaru
"Whoopsie, I suppose.",Beatrice
It's not funny!!,Subaru
